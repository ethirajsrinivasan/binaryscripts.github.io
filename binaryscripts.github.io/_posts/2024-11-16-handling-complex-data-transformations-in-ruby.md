Data transformations are at the core of many software applications, especially when dealing with APIs, databases, or large datasets. Ruby's expressive syntax and rich library ecosystem make it an excellent choice for handling complex data transformations. In this guide, we’ll dive into advanced techniques and best practices for efficiently managing and transforming data in Ruby.

### The Challenges of Complex Data Transformations

Handling complex data often involves:
- **Nested Data Structures**: JSON or XML with multiple levels of nesting.
- **Performance Optimization**: Minimizing processing time for large datasets.
- **Data Integrity**: Ensuring the transformed data is accurate and complete.
- **Flexible Pipelines**: Allowing for modular and reusable transformation steps.

To address these challenges, Ruby provides tools and libraries that simplify the process while maintaining high code readability and performance.

### Working with Nested Data Structures

#### Parsing and Traversing JSON

JSON is a common data format. Ruby's `JSON` module makes parsing straightforward.

```ruby
require "json"

raw_data = '{
"user": {
"name": "John Doe",
"contacts": {
"email": "john.doe@example.com",
"phone": "123-456-7890"
}
}
}'

data = JSON.parse(raw_data)
puts data["user"]["contacts"]["email"]
# Output: john.doe@example.com
```

#### Simplifying Access with `Hash` Extensions

Ruby hashes can be extended to make accessing nested keys easier.

```ruby
class Hash
def dig_deep(*keys)
keys.reduce(self) { |acc, key| acc.is_a?(Hash) ? acc[key] : nil }
end
end

email = data.dig_deep("user", "contacts", "email")
puts email
# Output: john.doe@example.com
```

### Transforming Data with Enumerators

#### Chaining Transformations

Ruby’s `Enumerator` allows for efficient chaining of transformations.

```ruby
data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

transformed = data.lazy
.map { |n| n * 2 }
.select { |n| n > 5 }
.take(2)
.force

puts transformed
# Output: [6, 8]
```

#### Using `Enumerable#inject` for Complex Reductions

`inject` (or `reduce`) is ideal for aggregating complex data.

```ruby
orders = [
{ item: "Book", price: 12.99 },
{ item: "Pen", price: 1.49 },
{ item: "Notebook", price: 5.99 }
]

total_cost = orders.inject(0) { |sum, order| sum + order[:price] }
puts total_cost
# Output: 20.47
```

---

### Performance Optimization Techniques

#### Batch Processing Large Datasets

Avoid processing data all at once by batching.

```ruby
large_data = (1..1_000_000).to_a

large_data.each_slice(10_000) do |batch|
puts "Processing batch of size: #{batch.size}"
end
```

#### Multi-Threading with `Thread`

Ruby’s `Thread` can speed up parallelizable tasks.

```ruby
require "json"

data_chunks = Array.new(4) { (1..1000).to_a }
threads = data_chunks.map do |chunk|
Thread.new do
transformed_chunk = chunk.map { |n| n * 2 }
puts "Processed chunk of size #{transformed_chunk.size}"
end
end

threads.each(&:join)
```

### Modular Data Transformation Pipelines

#### Building Pipelines with Plain Ruby

Create reusable pipeline steps as lambdas or methods.

```ruby
steps = [
->(data) { data.map { |n| n * 2 } },
->(data) { data.select { |n| n > 10 } },
->(data) { data.sort }
]

data = [3, 6, 1, 8]
pipeline = steps.reduce(data) { |acc, step| step.call(acc) }
puts pipeline
# Output: [12, 16]
```

#### Using `Dry-Transaction` for Robust Pipelines

The `dry-transaction` gem offers a structured way to create pipelines.

```ruby
require "dry/transaction"

class DataPipeline
include Dry::Transaction

step :double
step :filter

def double(input)
Success(input.map { |n| n * 2 })
end

def filter(input)
Success(input.select { |n| n > 10 })
end
end

pipeline = DataPipeline.new
result = pipeline.call([3, 6, 1, 8])
puts result.success
# Output: [12, 16]
```

### Ensuring Data Integrity

#### Validating Data with `ActiveModel`

Use `ActiveModel` validations for data integrity.

```ruby
require "active_model"

class Order
include ActiveModel::Validations

attr_accessor :item, :price

validates :item, presence: true
validates :price, numericality: { greater_than: 0 }
end

order = Order.new(item: "Book", price: 12.99)
puts order.valid?
# Output: true
```
