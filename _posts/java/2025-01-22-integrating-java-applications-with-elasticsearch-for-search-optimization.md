In the era of data-driven applications, **search functionality** is a must-have. Whether you’re building an e-commerce platform or a content discovery system, users expect fast and relevant search results. **Elasticsearch**, a distributed search and analytics engine, is a top choice for implementing powerful search capabilities in **Java applications**.

This post covers the full integration cycle — from connecting your Java app to Elasticsearch, to designing schemas and optimizing queries for performance. If you're already using Java for microservices or big data systems, this guide is essential for building high-performance search features.

#### Why Elasticsearch for Java Applications?

Elasticsearch is not just a search engine — it’s a scalable, distributed solution that can handle:
- Full-text search
- Real-time analytics
- Geo-search and autocomplete
- Large-scale data ingestion

**Key benefits:**
- RESTful interface and JSON-based query language
- Native support for Spring and Java clients
- Near real-time indexing and querying
- Scalable horizontal architecture

#### Setting Up Elasticsearch with Java

To integrate Elasticsearch with Java, you can either interact with it via its **RESTful API** or use the **Elasticsearch Java High-Level REST Client**.

Add the following Maven dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
<groupId>org.elasticsearch.client</groupId>
<artifactId>elasticsearch-rest-high-level-client</artifactId>
<version>7.17.0</version>
</dependency>
```

Next, configure the client in your application:

```java
RestHighLevelClient client = new RestHighLevelClient(
RestClient.builder(new HttpHost("localhost", 9200, "http"))
);
```

#### Indexing Documents from Java

Before querying, you must **index** your data. Define your domain model:

```java
public class Product {
private String id;
private String name;
private String description;
private double price;
}
```

Then convert it to JSON and send it to Elasticsearch:

```java
IndexRequest request = new IndexRequest("products")
.id(product.getId())
.source(new ObjectMapper().writeValueAsString(product), XContentType.JSON);
client.index(request, RequestOptions.DEFAULT);
```

---

#### Writing Search Queries

Elasticsearch supports a powerful query DSL. Here's how to search by product name:

```java
SearchRequest searchRequest = new SearchRequest("products");
SearchSourceBuilder sourceBuilder = new SearchSourceBuilder();
sourceBuilder.query(QueryBuilders.matchQuery("name", "laptop"));
searchRequest.source(sourceBuilder);
SearchResponse response = client.search(searchRequest, RequestOptions.DEFAULT);
```

**Tip:** Use filters (`term`, `range`) when exact values are known for better performance.

---

#### Aggregations and Analytics

You can run analytics like average prices or category distribution using aggregations:

```java
sourceBuilder.aggregation(
AggregationBuilders.avg("avg_price").field("price")
);
```

Aggregations are extremely useful in dashboards and reporting features.

---

#### Performance Tuning and Best Practices

1. **Use filters over full-text queries** when possible.
2. **Paginate** large result sets with `search_after` instead of `from + size`.
3. Keep document size below **10KB** for faster indexing.
4. Use **bulk requests** for batching multiple insert/update/delete operations.

```java
BulkRequest bulkRequest = new BulkRequest();
products.forEach(p -> {
IndexRequest req = new IndexRequest("products").id(p.getId())
.source(convertToJson(p), XContentType.JSON);
bulkRequest.add(req);
});
client.bulk(bulkRequest, RequestOptions.DEFAULT);
```

---

#### Integrating with Spring Boot

Spring Boot makes the integration more elegant:

```java
@Document(indexName = "products")
public class Product {
@Id private String id;
private String name;
private String description;
private double price;
}
```

And your repository:

```java
public interface ProductRepository extends ElasticsearchRepository<Product, String> {
List<Product> findByName(String name);
}
```

---

#### Conclusion

Integrating Elasticsearch into your Java application can dramatically improve your app’s **search capabilities**, scalability, and analytics power. Whether you’re running a SaaS product or an internal enterprise dashboard, using **Elasticsearch with Java** opens the door to building intuitive, fast, and insightful user experiences.
