As modern applications handle **billions of records**, choosing the right **data structures and algorithms** becomes **critical** for performance and scalability. Java, being a widely used language for **high-performance computing and distributed systems**, provides powerful tools to **optimize memory, execution time, and parallel processing**.

In this article, we will explore **advanced data structures and algorithms** in Java that help build **scalable, efficient systems**. We will focus on **high-performance collections, caching strategies, tree-based structures, graph algorithms, and parallel computing techniques**.

## Optimizing Collections for Scalability

### ConcurrentHashMap - Thread-Safe and High-Throughput

For multi-threaded applications, **`ConcurrentHashMap`** outperforms traditional `HashMap` by allowing **concurrent reads and writes**.

#### Why `ConcurrentHashMap`?
- **Segmented Locking** - Reduces contention by locking only specific segments.
- **Thread-Safety** - Avoids `ConcurrentModificationException`.
- **Scalability** - Supports **high read-write operations** in multi-threaded environments.

```java
Map<String, Integer> map = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();
map.put("users", 1000);
System.out.println(map.get("users")); // Output: 1000
```

### Skip List - Alternative to Balanced Trees

Java's `ConcurrentSkipListMap` provides **logarithmic time complexity** for **insertions, deletions, and lookups**, making it a great choice for **distributed caches and message queues**.

```java
ConcurrentSkipListMap<Integer, String> skipList = new ConcurrentSkipListMap<>();
skipList.put(1, "Alice");
skipList.put(2, "Bob");
System.out.println(skipList.firstEntry().getValue()); // Output: Alice
```

## Efficient Caching Mechanisms

### LRU Cache Implementation with `LinkedHashMap`

For **memory-sensitive applications**, **Least Recently Used (LRU) Cache** prevents memory overflow by **evicting the least accessed items**.

```java
class LRUCache<K, V> extends LinkedHashMap<K, V> {
    private final int capacity;

    public LRUCache(int capacity) {
        super(capacity, 0.75f, true);
        this.capacity = capacity;
    }

    @Override
    protected boolean removeEldestEntry(Map.Entry<K, V> eldest) {
        return size() > capacity;
    }
}

LRUCache<Integer, String> cache = new LRUCache<>(3);
cache.put(1, "Data A");
cache.put(2, "Data B");
cache.put(3, "Data C");
cache.put(4, "Data D"); // Oldest entry (1, "Data A") is evicted
```

### Bloom Filters - Memory-Efficient Set Membership

Bloom filters provide **probabilistic membership checking** in **constant time (O(1))**, used in **fraud detection, spell checkers, and distributed databases**.

```java
import com.google.common.hash.BloomFilter;
import com.google.common.hash.Funnels;

BloomFilter<Integer> bloomFilter = BloomFilter.create(Funnels.integerFunnel(), 500, 0.01);
bloomFilter.put(100);
System.out.println(bloomFilter.mightContain(100)); // Output: true
System.out.println(bloomFilter.mightContain(200)); // Output: false (most likely)
```

## Advanced Tree and Graph Algorithms

### B-Trees for Indexing Large Datasets

B-Trees are widely used in **databases and file systems** due to their ability to maintain **sorted data** with **efficient range queries**.

```java
class BTreeNode {
    int[] keys;
    int t;
    BTreeNode[] children;
    boolean leaf;
}
```

### Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm for Shortest Path Optimization

Graph-based algorithms like **Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm** are used in **network routing, recommendation systems, and transportation planning**.

```java
PriorityQueue<int[]> pq = new PriorityQueue<>(Comparator.comparingInt(a -> a[1]));
pq.offer(new int[]{source, 0});
while (!pq.isEmpty()) {
    int[] current = pq.poll();
    int node = current[0], cost = current[1];
    for (int[] neighbor : graph.get(node)) {
        int newCost = cost + neighbor[1];
        pq.offer(new int[]{neighbor[0], newCost});
    }
}
```

## Parallel Computing for Scalability

### ForkJoinPool for Parallel Processing

For **large-scale data processing**, `ForkJoinPool` helps in **recursive parallel execution**.

```java
class SumTask extends RecursiveTask<Integer> {
    private int[] arr;
    private int start, end;

    SumTask(int[] arr, int start, int end) {
        this.arr = arr;
        this.start = start;
        this.end = end;
    }

    @Override
    protected Integer compute() {
        if (end - start <= 10) {
            return IntStream.range(start, end).map(i -> arr[i]).sum();
        }
        int mid = (start + end) / 2;
        SumTask left = new SumTask(arr, start, mid);
        SumTask right = new SumTask(arr, mid, end);
        left.fork();
        return right.compute() + left.join();
    }
}
```

### Parallel Streams for Faster Data Processing

Javaâ€™s **parallel streams** optimize computations on **large datasets**.

```java
List<Integer> numbers = IntStream.range(1, 1000000).boxed().collect(Collectors.toList());
long sum = numbers.parallelStream().mapToInt(Integer::intValue).sum();
System.out.println("Parallel Sum: " + sum);
```
