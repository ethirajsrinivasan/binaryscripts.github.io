Apache Hive enables SQL-like querying on massive datasets stored in Hadoop or cloud-based data lakes. While basic HiveQL operations cover standard CRUD tasks, real-world analytics often require **advanced SQL techniques** to extract meaningful insights from large and complex datasets.

In this guide, we explore **advanced SQL capabilities in Hive**, including **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**, **window functions**, **correlated subqueries**, **advanced joins**, and **set operations** — empowering data analysts to perform rich, scalable analytics using familiar SQL syntax.

---

#### 1. Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

CTEs improve query readability and allow reusing logic within complex queries. Defined using the `WITH` clause, they act like temporary views.

**Example: Daily active users by region**

```sql
WITH daily_users AS (
SELECT user_id, region, date(event_time) AS event_date
FROM user_activity
WHERE event_type = 'login'
GROUP BY user_id, region, date(event_time)
)
SELECT region, event_date, COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS active_users
FROM daily_users
GROUP BY region, event_date;
```

CTEs help organize queries into logical building blocks, especially when nested aggregations or filters are required.

---

#### 2. Window Functions

Window functions perform calculations across rows related to the current row without collapsing result sets. They are ideal for **rankings**, **running totals**, and **comparisons across rows**.

**Example: Ranking customers by spend per region**

```sql
SELECT
customer_id,
region,
total_spent,
RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY region ORDER BY total_spent DESC) AS regional_rank
FROM (
SELECT customer_id, region, SUM(amount) AS total_spent
FROM transactions
GROUP BY customer_id, region
) t;
```

Hive supports functions like `RANK()`, `ROW_NUMBER()`, `DENSE_RANK()`, `NTILE()`, and aggregates like `SUM() OVER`, `AVG() OVER`.

---

#### 3. Advanced Joins

Hive supports all major join types: `INNER`, `LEFT OUTER`, `RIGHT OUTER`, `FULL OUTER`, and `CROSS JOIN`. For large datasets, **map-side joins** and **bucket map joins** improve performance.

**Example: Left join with fallback logic**

```sql
SELECT a.order_id, a.customer_id, COALESCE(b.region, 'Unknown') AS region
FROM orders a
LEFT JOIN customers b
ON a.customer_id = b.customer_id;
```

**Tip**: Optimize joins with `hive.auto.convert.join` (map-side joins) and consider bucketing for large dimension tables.

---

#### 4. Correlated and Uncorrelated Subqueries

Subqueries allow you to filter, aggregate, or compare data sets inline.

**Example: Find customers whose orders exceed their average order value**

```sql
SELECT customer_id, order_id, amount
FROM orders o
WHERE amount > (
SELECT AVG(amount)
FROM orders
WHERE customer_id = o.customer_id
);
```

Hive supports both correlated (referencing outer queries) and uncorrelated subqueries, though correlated queries may perform slower on large tables.

---

#### 5. Set Operations: UNION, INTERSECT, EXCEPT

Set operations combine results from multiple queries.

**UNION ALL vs UNION**

- `UNION ALL` includes duplicates
- `UNION` removes duplicates

**Example: Union of active and trial users**

```sql
SELECT user_id FROM active_users
UNION
SELECT user_id FROM trial_users;
```

As of recent Hive versions:
- `INTERSECT` and `EXCEPT` are supported with certain limitations
- Recommended to check Hive version compatibility

---

#### 6. Pivoting Data with CASE and GROUP BY

Hive lacks native `PIVOT`, but you can simulate it using conditional aggregation.

**Example: Page views by device type**

```sql
SELECT
date,
SUM(CASE WHEN device = 'mobile' THEN views ELSE 0 END) AS mobile_views,
SUM(CASE WHEN device = 'desktop' THEN views ELSE 0 END) AS desktop_views
FROM pageviews
GROUP BY date;
```

This technique is useful for transforming rows into columns in analytics dashboards.

---

#### 7. Aggregations with GROUPING SETS, CUBE, ROLLUP

Group multiple aggregation levels in a single query.

**Example: Total sales by region, product, and both**

```sql
SELECT region, product, SUM(sales)
FROM sales_data
GROUP BY region, product
WITH CUBE;
```

- `ROLLUP`: aggregates in a hierarchy (e.g., year → month → day)
- `CUBE`: aggregates across all combinations of columns

---

#### 8. Pattern Matching with LIKE and RLIKE

Hive supports both `LIKE` (simple wildcard) and `RLIKE` (regex-based) pattern matching.

**Examples:**

```sql
-- LIKE
SELECT * FROM logs WHERE message LIKE '%error%';

-- RLIKE
SELECT * FROM logs WHERE message RLIKE '^WARN|ERROR';
```

Use RLIKE for advanced filtering in log analysis or ETL pipelines.

---

#### 9. Date and Time Functions for Time-Series Analysis

Hive offers robust functions for manipulating time:

- `date_format()`
- `unix_timestamp()`
- `from_unixtime()`
- `datediff()`
- `current_date`, `now()`

**Example: Aggregating weekly user activity**

```sql
SELECT
user_id,
weekofyear(event_time) AS week,
COUNT(*) AS logins
FROM login_events
GROUP BY user_id, weekofyear(event_time);
```

---

#### 10. User-Defined Functions (UDFs)

When built-in SQL isn’t enough, Hive lets you register **custom UDFs** in Java, Python (via HiveServer2 + PyHive), or use Hive’s built-in UDFs for string, math, and date processing.

**Example: Hashing emails for anonymization**

```sql
SELECT user_id, sha2(email, 256) AS hashed_email FROM users;
```

Register custom UDFs using:

```sql
ADD JAR /path/to/udf.jar;
CREATE TEMPORARY FUNCTION my_custom_udf AS 'com.company.udfs.MyUDF';
```

---

#### Best Practices for Analysts

- Use **CTEs** for modular, readable queries
- Leverage **window functions** for row-wise analytics
- Avoid overly nested subqueries — test performance on subsets
- Use `EXPLAIN` to understand query plans and bottlenecks
- Combine filters with partitioning for faster query execution

---

#### Conclusion

Advanced SQL in Hive empowers data analysts to perform **sophisticated analysis** without complex ETL logic or custom code. Whether you're ranking customers, analyzing trends, or building dashboards, mastering these techniques helps you unlock deeper insights from massive datasets.

By combining Hive’s scalability with rich SQL features, you gain the ability to transform raw data into decision-ready intelligence — all from the comfort of your HiveQL console.
