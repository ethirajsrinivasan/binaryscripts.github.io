Apache Hive is widely used for querying large-scale datasets in data lakes. However, as data grows, **query performance** becomes a key concern. Hive provides a detailed **execution plan** that outlines how it processes a query, helping developers identify bottlenecks and apply targeted optimizations.

In this post, we’ll dive deep into **Hive query execution plans**, explain how to read them, and share practical tips to **optimize slow queries** using configuration tuning, better join strategies, and efficient file formats.

#### What Is a Hive Execution Plan?

A Hive execution plan shows the **logical and physical steps** the engine takes to execute a query. This includes:

- Table scans and filters
- Join operations
- MapReduce or Tez stages
- Partition and bucket pruning
- File format handling

Understanding the plan helps you spot performance issues like:
- Full table scans
- Unnecessary shuffles
- Suboptimal joins
- Lack of partition pruning

---

#### Viewing an Execution Plan

To view the query plan, prefix your query with `EXPLAIN`:

```sql
EXPLAIN
SELECT customer_id, SUM(amount)
FROM sales
WHERE year = 2024
GROUP BY customer_id;
```

For more detail:

```sql
EXPLAIN EXTENDED SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_id = '1001';
```

Or:

```sql
EXPLAIN FORMATTED SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 30;
```

#### Key Sections in the Plan

The plan consists of several blocks. Key ones include:

- **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST):** Parsed representation of the query
- **Logical Plan:** Includes operators like TableScan, Filter, Join, GroupBy
- **Stage Breakdown:** Each MapReduce or Tez stage
- **File Scans:** What files and partitions are read
- **Statistics:** Row counts and sizes (if enabled)

Example snippet:

```
Stage: Stage-1
Map Reduce
Map Operator Tree:
TableScan
Partition Filters: year = 2024
Group By
Aggregations: sum(amount)
```

This tells you:
- A partition filter was applied ✅
- Grouping happens in the mapper stage ✅

---

#### Common Optimization Opportunities

**1. Enable Partition Pruning**

Make sure filters are on **partition columns**:

✅ Optimized:

```sql
SELECT * FROM logs WHERE year = 2023 AND month = 01;
```

❌ Not optimized:

```sql
SELECT * FROM logs WHERE to_date(timestamp) = '2023-01-01';
```

Partition pruning avoids scanning unnecessary HDFS directories.

---

**2. Use Columnar File Formats**

Prefer **ORC** or **Parquet** over CSV/JSON for large datasets:

```sql
CREATE TABLE transactions (
id STRING, amount DOUBLE
)
STORED AS ORC;
```

Columnar formats improve:
- Compression
- I/O performance
- Predicate pushdown

---

**3. Analyze Join Order and Type**

Hive defaults to **common joins**, but may choose:
- **MapJoin (broadcast)**
- **SortMergeJoin**
- **Skewed Join**

You can force broadcast join for small tables:

```sql
SET hive.auto.convert.join=true;
SET hive.mapjoin.smalltable.filesize=25000000;
```

Use `EXPLAIN` to confirm join type:

```
Join Cond: customer.id = order.customer_id
Join Type: Map Join (customer broadcasted)
```

---

**4. Vectorization and Tez Execution**

Ensure Hive is using **vectorized query execution** and **Tez engine**:

```sql
SET hive.execution.engine=tez;
SET hive.vectorized.execution.enabled=true;
```

Vectorization boosts performance for CPU-intensive queries.

---

**5. Use Stats for Cost-Based Optimization**

Enable statistics collection for better query planning:

```sql
ANALYZE TABLE sales COMPUTE STATISTICS;
ANALYZE TABLE sales PARTITION(year) COMPUTE STATISTICS;
```

Stats help Hive:
- Choose the right join strategy
- Skip irrelevant partitions
- Estimate query costs more accurately

---

#### Troubleshooting Slow Queries

**Symptom:** Full scan on partitioned table  
**Fix:** Filter on partition columns and check plan for `Partition Filters`

**Symptom:** Shuffle-heavy joins  
**Fix:** Use bucketing or broadcast small tables

**Symptom:** High latency due to small files  
**Fix:** Compact small files or use merge scripts in ETL

**Symptom:** Wrong join order  
**Fix:** Tune CBO or manually rewrite query

---

#### Best Practices Summary

- Always `EXPLAIN` your queries during development
- Filter on partition columns directly
- Collect statistics after large loads
- Use ORC/Parquet + compression
- Tune for Tez and vectorized execution
- Monitor small file issues with `hdfs dfs -du`

---

#### Conclusion

Understanding and analyzing Hive's **query execution plan** is crucial for diagnosing performance bottlenecks and applying optimizations. With the right practices — partition pruning, join tuning, and format choices — you can significantly reduce query execution time and resource usage.

Make `EXPLAIN` part of your development workflow, and you'll unlock faster, smarter Hive queries across your data warehouse.
