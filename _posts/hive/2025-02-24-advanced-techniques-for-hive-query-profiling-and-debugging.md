Running Hive queries on large datasets can often result in **unexpectedly long runtimes**, **out-of-memory errors**, or **failed executions**. When performance degrades or queries fail, developers need the ability to **profile and debug Hive queries** effectively.

This blog post explores **advanced techniques for Hive query profiling and debugging**, helping you pinpoint inefficiencies and optimize query execution across Hive-on-Tez, Hive-on-Spark, or Hive-on-MapReduce environments.

#### Use EXPLAIN to Understand Query Plans

The `EXPLAIN` command provides insights into how Hive translates your SQL query into physical execution plans.

```sql
EXPLAIN
SELECT customer_id, COUNT(*) FROM transactions GROUP BY customer_id;
```

This output shows:
- Logical plan
- MapReduce/Tez stage breakdown
- Join strategies (e.g., map join vs. reduce join)
- Data shuffles and sort operations

Use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` (Hive 3.1+) for runtime metrics:

```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT * FROM sales WHERE year = 2024;
```

#### Analyze Tez DAGs and Execution Graphs

When using **Hive on Tez**, each query is compiled into a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). You can inspect this using the **Tez UI** or **Apache Ambari**.

Steps:
1. Note the DAG ID from Hive logs
2. Visit Tez UI (typically on port `8080`)
3. Examine DAG vertices, shuffle stages, and task attempts
4. Look for bottlenecks in slow tasks or skewed reducers

Key metrics to look for:
- Number of bytes read/written
- Shuffle size per stage
- Skewed task distribution
- GC time and I/O wait

---

#### Check Hive Logs and Job Logs

Hive logs contain vital debugging information. Look in:

- HiveServer2 logs (`hiveserver2.log`)
- Application logs on YARN (`yarn logs -applicationId <app_id>`)
- Hive client logs (stderr/stdout for CLI or Beeline)

Search for:
- `ERROR`, `WARN`, or `FAILED` messages
- Stages that hang or retry frequently
- Resource constraints (`Container killed by the ApplicationMaster`)

Set verbose logging for debugging:

```bash
SET hive.root.logger=DEBUG,console;
```

---

#### Use Job Counters and Metrics

Hive queries generate **MapReduce or Tez job counters** that expose useful metrics:

```
- HDFS bytes read/written
- Map and reduce task counts
- GC time, I/O time
- Records input/output per stage
  ```

You can access counters via:
- Tez UI counters tab
- `mapred job -status <job_id>` (for MapReduce)
- `yarn logs` for deeper task-level metrics

Counters help detect:
- Data skew
- Inefficient joins
- Unbalanced partitions

---

#### Enable Query Hooks for Profiling

You can inject hooks before/after query execution using `hive.exec.pre.hooks` and `hive.exec.post.hooks`.

Example: Log queries automatically

```java
public class LoggingHook implements ExecuteWithHookContext {
public void run(HookContext context) {
System.out.println("Query: " + context.getQueryPlan().getQueryStr());
}
}
```

Configure in `hive-site.xml`:

```xml
<property>
<name>hive.exec.post.hooks</name>
<value>com.example.hooks.LoggingHook</value>
</property>
```

This is useful for monitoring slow queries and triggering external alerts.

#### Debugging Common Performance Issues

**Issue:** Full table scan  
✅ **Fix:** Use partition filters  
✅ **Fix:** Avoid function on partition column in WHERE clause

**Issue:** Large number of small files  
✅ **Fix:** Use `hive.merge.mapfiles=true` and `hive.merge.smallfiles.avgsize`

**Issue:** Join spill or shuffle skew  
✅ **Fix:** Enable map joins  
✅ **Fix:** Use `hive.optimize.skewjoin=true`  
✅ **Fix:** Bucket large tables and collect stats

**Issue:** Long reducer time  
✅ **Fix:** Tune reducer count with  
```sql
SET hive.exec.reducers.bytes.per.reducer = 256000000;
```

#### Use Query Profiles in Hive LLAP

If you're running **Hive on LLAP (Low Latency Analytical Processing)**, you can access detailed query profiles via **Hive Query UI** (port 10502):

- View operator tree execution
- Timeline of stage durations
- Memory usage and peak I/O
- LLAP daemon-specific statistics

This helps optimize memory-bound queries or improve task parallelism.

---

#### Tune Execution Parameters

Adjust runtime settings to diagnose and optimize queries:

```sql
SET hive.tez.container.size = 4096;
SET hive.vectorized.execution.enabled = true;
SET hive.cbo.enable = true;
SET hive.exec.dynamic.partition.mode = nonstrict;
SET hive.optimize.bucketmapjoin = true;
```

Always validate these changes incrementally and monitor query performance impact.

---

#### Test with Sampling and LIMIT

For long-running queries, start by sampling:

```sql
SELECT * FROM transactions TABLESAMPLE(1 PERCENT);
```

Or test logic with `LIMIT`:

```sql
SELECT * FROM sales WHERE year = 2023 LIMIT 1000;
```

This prevents wasting resources on logic errors or bad joins during development.

---

#### Best Practices for Profiling Hive Queries

- Use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` for stage-level timing
- Review Tez DAGs to locate slow or skewed stages
- Collect and use table/column stats
- Prefer ORC with vectorized execution
- Monitor GC time, spilled records, and skew
- Use hooks and logs for long-term analysis
