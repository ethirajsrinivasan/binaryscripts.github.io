As enterprises manage petabytes of data in Hive, **data security** becomes critical. Unauthorized access, accidental data exposure, and compliance violations are real risks in large-scale data lakes.

**Apache Ranger** is a powerful framework that provides centralized security administration for Hadoop ecosystems. It allows you to define, enforce, and audit fine-grained access control policies across services like Hive, HDFS, Kafka, and more.

In this post, weâ€™ll explore how to integrate **Apache Hive with Apache Ranger** to enforce **row-level, column-level**, and **role-based access control** to protect sensitive data and meet security compliance standards.

---

#### What is Apache Ranger?

Apache Ranger is a centralized security solution that provides:

- **Policy-based access control** for Hadoop services
- Integration with LDAP/AD and Kerberos
- Support for **row-level and column-level filtering**
- **Audit logs** for all access events
- REST APIs for programmatic policy management

It supports Hive, HDFS, Kafka, HBase, Solr, and more, making it ideal for unified big data security governance.

#### Why Use Apache Ranger with Hive?

Out of the box, Hive offers limited authorization mechanisms:
- SQL-standard `GRANT`/`REVOKE`
- Storage-level ACLs (HDFS permissions)
- HiveServer2-based access control

However, Apache Ranger provides:
- **Fine-grained control** over tables, databases, columns
- **Row-level filtering** based on user identity
- **Attribute-based access control**
- **Auditing** of all access attempts
- A user-friendly **web UI** for managing permissions

---

#### Prerequisites

Before integrating Hive with Ranger, ensure the following:

- Apache Hive is installed and running on Hadoop
- Hive is secured with **Kerberos authentication**
- Apache Ranger Admin service is installed and accessible
- Ranger Hive plugin is available on Hive nodes

---

#### Installing Ranger Plugin for Hive

1. Download and extract the Ranger plugin:

```bash
cd /usr/local
wget https://downloads.apache.org/ranger/2.4.0/ranger-2.4.0-hive-plugin.tar.gz
tar -xzvf ranger-2.4.0-hive-plugin.tar.gz
```

2. Run the setup script to install the plugin:

```bash
cd ranger-2.4.0-hive-plugin
./enable-hive-plugin.sh
```

This configures HiveServer2 to communicate with the Ranger Admin and applies security policies during query execution.

3. Restart HiveServer2:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart hive-server2
```

---

#### Creating Hive Access Policies in Ranger

1. Log in to the **Ranger Admin UI** (default: `http://<ranger-host>:6080`)
2. Navigate to **Access Manager > Resource Based Policies > Hive**
3. Create a new policy with:
  - Resource: Database, Table, Column
  - Users/Groups: e.g., `analyst`, `admin`
  - Permissions: `select`, `update`, `create`, `drop`, etc.

Example policy:
- **Allow user 'analyst' to query only `customer_name` and `city`** in `customers` table

---

#### Implementing Row-Level and Column-Level Security

To enforce **column masking**:
- Select columns like `ssn`, `email`
- Choose a masking type: `Redact`, `Hash`, or `Custom`

To enforce **row filtering**:
- Add filter condition like:

```sql
department = '${USER.department}'
```

This ensures users can only access rows related to their department.

These rules are evaluated dynamically during query execution.

---

#### Enabling Auditing

Ranger supports audit logging via:
- Database (MySQL/PostgreSQL)
- HDFS (for secure, immutable audit logs)
- Solr (for searching and visualizing audits)

You can view all access attempts under the **Audit** tab in Ranger UI:
- User identity
- Access time
- Resource path
- Action (allowed/denied)
- Query executed

Audits are essential for compliance (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2) and forensics.

---

#### LDAP and AD Integration

You can integrate Ranger with enterprise directory services:

```properties
ranger.usersync.ldap.url=ldap://ldap.company.com:389
ranger.usersync.ldap.binddn=cn=admin,dc=company,dc=com
ranger.usersync.ldap.bindpassword=secret
```

User groups and attributes can be imported and used in policies to simplify management.

---

#### Best Practices

- Enforce **least privilege**: give users only the permissions they need
- Regularly review and audit policies
- Mask PII fields using **column-level security**
- Use **row-level filtering** to separate tenants or departments
- Enable **Kerberos** to authenticate and secure HiveServer2
- Use **attribute-based policies** for dynamic access control
- Centralize auditing across Hive, HDFS, and other Hadoop services

---

#### Conclusion

Apache Ranger provides a comprehensive security layer for Hive by enabling fine-grained access control, auditing, and compliance-friendly governance. By integrating Hive with Ranger, you ensure **secure, compliant, and auditable** access to your big data platform.

Whether you're dealing with regulated industries, internal role segregation, or just want to protect sensitive datasets, combining Hive with Ranger is a best practice for enterprise-grade data security.
