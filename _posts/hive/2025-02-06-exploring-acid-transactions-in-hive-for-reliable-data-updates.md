excerpt: Learn how Apache Hive implements ACID transactions for reliable data updates and deletes. Explore transactional tables, compaction, isolation levels, and best practices for managing consistent big data.
---
Historically, Apache Hive was optimized for append-only workloads, limiting its use in **OLTP-style operations** such as updates and deletes. This changed with the introduction of **ACID transactions** in Hive 0.14 and their stabilization in Hive 3.x, enabling **reliable, transactional data handling** on Hadoop.

In this post, we explore how **Hive supports ACID semantics** — including inserts, updates, deletes, and full transactions — while operating over distributed storage like HDFS. You'll learn how to configure transactional tables, manage compactions, and ensure data consistency in a big data environment.

#### What Are ACID Transactions in Hive?

ACID stands for:

- **Atomicity** – All operations in a transaction succeed or fail together
- **Consistency** – Data moves from one valid state to another
- **Isolation** – Transactions are isolated from one another
- **Durability** – Once committed, changes are permanent

Hive achieves this using a **delta file architecture** combined with **transactional metadata** stored in the Hive Metastore.

#### Requirements for ACID Transactions

To enable ACID transactions in Hive, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

- **Hive 3.x or later** (for full ACID support)
- **Transactional table** with ORC file format
- **Tez or LLAP** execution engine (MapReduce is not supported)
- **hive.support.concurrency = true**
- **Metastore backed by a relational DB** (e.g., MySQL, Postgres)

Enable required configs in `hive-site.xml` or `application.conf`:

```xml
<property>
<name>hive.support.concurrency</name>
<value>true</value>
</property>
<property>
<name>hive.txn.manager</name>
<value>org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.lockmgr.DbTxnManager</value>
</property>
<property>
<name>hive.compactor.initiator.on</name>
<value>true</value>
</property>
<property>
<name>hive.compactor.worker.threads</name>
<value>2</value>
</property>
```

---

#### Creating an ACID Table

Use the `TRANSACTIONAL` clause with ORC format:

```sql
CREATE TABLE customers (
id INT,
name STRING,
email STRING
)
CLUSTERED BY (id) INTO 4 BUCKETS
STORED AS ORC
TBLPROPERTIES ('transactional'='true');
```

You must bucket transactional tables — bucketing helps manage delta files efficiently.

---

#### Performing ACID Operations

ACID-enabled Hive tables support the following DML commands:

- **INSERT** (supports atomicity)
- **UPDATE** (row-level updates)
- **DELETE** (row-level deletes)
- **MERGE** (upserts and conditional updates)

**Example: Insert**

```sql
INSERT INTO customers VALUES (1, 'Alice', 'alice@example.com');
```

**Example: Update**

```sql
UPDATE customers SET email = 'newemail@example.com' WHERE id = 1;
```

**Example: Delete**

```sql
DELETE FROM customers WHERE id = 1;
```

**Example: Merge**

```sql
MERGE INTO customers AS target
USING staging_customers AS source
ON target.id = source.id
WHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE SET email = source.email
WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT VALUES (source.id, source.name, source.email);
```

#### Understanding the Delta File System

Hive ACID tables store data as **base files** and **delta files**:
- Base files hold the latest snapshot
- Delta files hold incremental updates/deletes

Each write operation generates new delta directories:

```
/warehouse/customers/delta_0000001_0000001/
/warehouse/customers/delete_delta_0000002_0000002/
```

Over time, this can degrade performance — which is why **compaction** is required.

---

#### Compaction in Hive

Hive performs **compaction** to merge delta files into base files, improving read efficiency.

- **Minor compaction** – merges delta files
- **Major compaction** – merges base and delta into a new base

Trigger compaction manually:

```sql
ALTER TABLE customers COMPACT 'major';
```

Monitor compaction status:

```sql
SHOW COMPACTIONS;
```

Automate compaction by enabling:

```xml
<property>
<name>hive.compactor.initiator.on</name>
<value>true</value>
</property>
<property>
<name>hive.compactor.worker.threads</name>
<value>4</value>
</property>
```

---

#### Isolation Levels and Transaction Handling

Hive supports **snapshot isolation** using a read-only view of the table. However, multi-statement transactions using `START TRANSACTION` are limited.

```sql
START TRANSACTION;
UPDATE customers SET name = 'Bob' WHERE id = 2;
DELETE FROM customers WHERE id = 3;
COMMIT;
```

Use this approach carefully, as not all Hive versions handle concurrent writes well across sessions.

---

#### ACID vs Non-ACID Table Performance

While ACID provides reliability, it can impact performance due to:

- Extra metadata management
- Delta file overhead
- Compaction delays

Use ACID **only when needed**:
- OLAP-style reporting = use external/non-ACID tables
- Data ingestion + occasional updates = use transactional tables

---

#### Best Practices

- Always use ORC format for ACID tables
- Monitor and schedule compaction regularly
- Avoid excessive small transactions — batch writes instead
- Use meaningful primary key + bucketed design
- Avoid `MERGE` on massive tables unless partitioned
- Prefer **partitioned** + **bucketed** design for large ACID tables

---

#### Conclusion

Apache Hive’s support for **ACID transactions** enables reliable data manipulation in distributed environments. By understanding delta files, compaction, and transaction boundaries, you can ensure **consistency and durability** in big data systems.

With Hive 3.x and beyond, ACID is production-ready — allowing you to confidently perform inserts, updates, deletes, and merges over petabyte-scale datasets stored on HDFS.
