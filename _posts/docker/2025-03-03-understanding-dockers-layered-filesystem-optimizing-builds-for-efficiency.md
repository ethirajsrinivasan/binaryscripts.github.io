Docker has revolutionized software packaging and deployment by introducing **lightweight containers** built from layers of filesystems. However, inefficient Dockerfile design can lead to **bloated images**, **longer build times**, and **cache invalidation issues**.

In this post, we’ll explore how Docker’s **layered filesystem** works, and share **practical tips** to write **efficient Dockerfiles** that result in **smaller, faster, and reusable container images** — perfect for production-grade pipelines.

#### What is Docker's Layered Filesystem?

Every Docker image is composed of a **stack of read-only layers**, with a writable container layer added on top when a container is started.

Each instruction in a Dockerfile (like `RUN`, `COPY`, `ADD`) creates a **new image layer**. These layers are:

- **Immutable**: Once created, a layer does not change
- **Cached**: Reused across builds if the layer instructions haven’t changed
- **Shared**: Between images and containers to save disk space

Example layer stack:

```
ubuntu:20.04  
├── Layer 1: FROM ubuntu:20.04  
├── Layer 2: RUN apt-get update  
├── Layer 3: RUN apt-get install -y python3  
├── Layer 4: COPY app/ /usr/src/app  
├── Layer 5: RUN pip install -r requirements.txt  
```

#### How Docker Builds Images

When you build a Dockerfile:

1. Docker evaluates each line sequentially
2. It checks for a cached layer based on:
  - Instruction type
  - Contents of files involved
3. If unchanged, it **reuses the layer**
4. If changed, it **invalidates the cache** for that instruction and all layers that follow

**Tip**: Order your instructions from least to most frequently changed.

#### Optimizing Your Dockerfile: Best Practices

##### 1. **Minimize Layers**

Combine commands using `&&` and `\` to reduce layers:

```Dockerfile
RUN apt-get update && \
apt-get install -y curl git python3
```

##### 2. **Leverage Layer Caching**

Move frequently-changing instructions (like `COPY . .`) to the bottom:

```Dockerfile
COPY requirements.txt .  
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt  
COPY . .  # <- This should come after installing dependencies
```

##### 3. **Use `.dockerignore` File**

Exclude files that don’t need to be copied (e.g., `.git`, `node_modules`, `*.log`) to speed up context transfer and cache validity.

```.dockerignore
.git  
*.log  
__pycache__/
.env  
node_modules/
```

##### 4. **Choose Lightweight Base Images**

Use minimal images like Alpine or Distroless:

```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-alpine
# or
FROM gcr.io/distroless/python3
```

This can cut image sizes by 70–90%.

---
Cache breaks when:

- File contents change
- Order of Dockerfile instructions changes
- ENV variables or ARGs change
- Dependencies (like pip packages) change

**Tip**: Use checksum-based install practices to retain cache:

```Dockerfile
COPY requirements.txt .  
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
```

---

#### Multi-Stage Builds for Clean Final Images

Multi-stage builds allow you to **compile code in one image**, and **copy only the artifacts** into a slim final image:

```Dockerfile
# Stage 1: Builder
FROM golang:1.20 AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN go build -o app .

# Stage 2: Final
FROM alpine
COPY --from=builder /app/app /usr/bin/app
CMD ["app"]
```

This removes dev dependencies and reduces size.

---

#### Visualizing Layers

Use the `dive` tool to inspect layers and identify waste:

```bash
brew install dive
dive my-app:latest
```

This shows you which layers add the most size and which files can be removed or merged.

#### Summary of Tips

| Tip                               | Benefit                          |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Combine `RUN` commands           | Fewer layers, smaller image      |
| Order COPY/ADD logically         | Better caching                   |
| Use `.dockerignore`              | Smaller build context            |
| Base on Alpine/Distroless        | Lightweight image                |
| Multi-stage builds               | Clean, production-ready images   |
| Inspect with `dive`              | Visualize layer inefficiencies   |

#### Conclusion

Understanding Docker’s layered filesystem unlocks the key to **efficient and maintainable container builds**. By structuring your Dockerfiles strategically and leveraging multi-stage builds, cache layering, and slim base images, you can deliver **faster pipelines**, **smaller images**, and **more reliable deployments**.

Adopt these practices today and optimize your containers for the future of cloud-native development.
