Modern applications are rapidly shifting to **microservices architectures**, where loosely coupled services interact over well-defined APIs. To support agile deployment and scalability, teams increasingly use **Docker** to containerize and run these microservices.

This blog explores how to **build and deploy REST APIs using Docker** within microservices environments. We’ll walk through Dockerfile creation, environment variable injection, networking, and strategies for seamless deployment in production.

---

#### Why Use Docker for REST APIs?

Docker simplifies the REST API lifecycle by offering:

- **Consistent environments** across dev, test, and production
- **Isolation** for each microservice
- Lightweight, **portable containers**
- Seamless **CI/CD integration**
- Compatibility with **orchestration tools** like Kubernetes and Docker Swarm

This allows independent development and deployment of services while minimizing conflicts and downtime.

---

#### Project Structure for a Sample API

Here’s a typical layout for a REST API project (e.g., using Spring Boot, Flask, or Express):

```
/user-service
├── app/
│   └── api.py
├── requirements.txt
├── Dockerfile
└── .env
```

Let’s create a Dockerfile for this service.

---

#### Creating a Dockerfile

Example: Flask-based Python REST API

```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.10-slim

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

EXPOSE 5000

CMD ["python", "app/api.py"]
```

Best practices:
- Use a **slim base image**
- Install only what you need
- Avoid using `latest` tags for reproducibility

---

#### Building and Running the Container

```bash
docker build -t user-service .
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --env-file .env user-service
```

Use `--env-file` to inject environment variables like DB credentials or API tokens.

---

#### Docker Networking Between Services

In a microservices setup, services must talk to each other. Docker Compose simplifies this:

**docker-compose.yml:**

```yml
version: '3'
services:
user-service:
build: ./user-service
ports:
- "5000:5000"
environment:
- DB_HOST=db
depends_on:
- db

db:
image: postgres:13
environment:
- POSTGRES_PASSWORD=secret
```

Now `user-service` can access Postgres at hostname `db`.

---

#### Handling API Configuration

Avoid hardcoding config. Use `.env` files or secrets management:

```env
PORT=5000
DB_HOST=db
DB_USER=admin
DB_PASSWORD=supersecure
```

Access in your code via environment variables:

Python:
```python
import os
db_host = os.getenv("DB_HOST")
```

Java (Spring Boot):
```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://${DB_HOST}:${DB_PORT}/mydb
```

---

#### Deploying with Orchestration (Docker Swarm / Kubernetes)

For scalability and fault tolerance, use orchestration:

- **Docker Swarm**:
  ```bash
  docker swarm init
  docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml microservice-stack
  ```

- **Kubernetes**:
  Convert your Dockerized app to a deployment + service using Helm or YAML:

```yml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
name: user-service
spec:
replicas: 3
selector:
matchLabels:
app: user-service
template:
metadata:
labels:
app: user-service
spec:
containers:
- name: user-service
image: user-service:latest
ports:
- containerPort: 5000
envFrom:
- configMapRef:
name: user-service-config
```

---

#### Monitoring and Logging

Use Docker logging drivers or forward logs to ELK stack:

```bash
docker logs user-service
```

Best practices:
- Implement **structured logging** (JSON format)
- Use sidecars or exporters (e.g., **Prometheus + Grafana**) for metrics

#### Best Practices Summary

| Practice                        | Benefit                                      |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Minimal base image             | Reduces image size and attack surface        |
| Multi-stage builds             | Speeds up CI and reduces final image size    |
| Environment configs            | Decouples code from deployment settings      |
| Health checks                  | Ensures service readiness for orchestration  |
| Volume mounts (for dev)        | Speeds up local iteration                    |

#### Conclusion

Docker is a powerful enabler for **building, deploying, and scaling REST APIs** in microservices architectures. It simplifies dependency management, improves deployment velocity, and integrates seamlessly with modern DevOps tools.

By following containerization best practices and leveraging Docker Compose or Kubernetes, you can confidently deploy APIs that are **resilient, portable, and production-ready**.
