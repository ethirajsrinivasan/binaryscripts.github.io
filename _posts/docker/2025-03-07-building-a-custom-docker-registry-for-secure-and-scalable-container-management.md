As containerized applications become the norm in modern software delivery, organizations need **secure, scalable, and efficient ways to manage Docker images**. While public registries like Docker Hub are useful, they may not meet enterprise needs for **privacy, control, and speed**.

This guide walks you through setting up a **custom Docker registry**, enabling **TLS encryption**, **authentication**, and **scaling strategies** for managing container images securely within your infrastructure.

---

#### Why Use a Custom Docker Registry?

Benefits include:

- **Security**: Host images in your own network with encryption and access control
- **Performance**: Reduce external dependency and speed up deployments
- **Control**: Apply custom image retention, tagging, and cleanup policies
- **Compliance**: Meet internal or industry regulations (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR)
- **CI/CD Integration**: Seamless integration with pipelines without rate limiting

---

#### Step 1: Basic Registry Setup with Docker

Start by running a registry container:

```bash
docker run -d \
--name my-registry \
-p 5000:5000 \
registry:2
```

This sets up an **open, unauthenticated registry** accessible on port 5000.

Test by pushing an image:

```bash
docker tag nginx localhost:5000/nginx
docker push localhost:5000/nginx
```

---

#### Step 2: Enable TLS for Secure Image Transfer

To secure your registry:

1. Generate self-signed or trusted TLS certificates:

```bash
openssl req -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes -sha256 -keyout domain.key \
-x509 -days 365 -out domain.crt
```

2. Mount certs to the registry container:

```bash
docker run -d \
--name my-registry \
-v $(pwd)/certs:/certs \
-e REGISTRY_HTTP_TLS_CERTIFICATE=/certs/domain.crt \
-e REGISTRY_HTTP_TLS_KEY=/certs/domain.key \
-p 443:5000 \
registry:2
```

3. Configure Docker clients to trust the cert (or disable cert verification in dev).

---

#### Step 3: Add Basic Authentication

1. Install `htpasswd` and generate credentials:

```bash
htpasswd -Bbn admin strongpassword > auth/htpasswd
```

2. Run registry with auth enabled:

```bash
docker run -d \
--name my-registry \
-v $(pwd)/auth:/auth \
-v $(pwd)/certs:/certs \
-e "REGISTRY_AUTH=htpasswd" \
-e "REGISTRY_AUTH_HTPASSWD_REALM=Registry Realm" \
-e "REGISTRY_AUTH_HTPASSWD_PATH=/auth/htpasswd" \
-e "REGISTRY_HTTP_TLS_CERTIFICATE=/certs/domain.crt" \
-e "REGISTRY_HTTP_TLS_KEY=/certs/domain.key" \
-p 443:5000 \
registry:2
```

Push and pull will now require credentials.

---

#### Step 4: Enable Storage Backend and Cleanup Policies

By default, images are stored on the containerâ€™s local filesystem.

To use external storage like S3:

```yaml
storage:
s3:
accesskey: YOUR_KEY
secretkey: YOUR_SECRET
region: us-east-1
bucket: my-registry-bucket
encrypt: true
```

You can also set:
- **Retention policies** using lifecycle scripts
- **Garbage collection** via:

```bash
registry garbage-collect /etc/docker/registry/config.yml
```

---

#### Step 5: High Availability and Scaling

To scale your registry:

- Use **HAProxy/Nginx** as a load balancer across multiple registry instances
- Store images in **shared backend** (e.g., S3 or NFS)
- Use **Redis** or **etcd** for shared caching or metadata if needed
- Deploy behind **Kubernetes Ingress** for better control and integration

---

#### Step 6: Kubernetes Integration

To use a private registry in Kubernetes:

1. Create a Docker registry secret:

```bash
kubectl create secret docker-registry regcred \
--docker-server=myregistry.com \
--docker-username=admin \
--docker-password=strongpassword \
--docker-email=you@example.com
```

2. Reference it in your pod:

```yaml
imagePullSecrets:
- name: regcred
  ```

---

#### Step 7: Monitor and Audit

Monitor your registry with:

- **Prometheus Exporters** (e.g., `registry_exporter`)
- **Access logs** via Docker logs
- **Audit trails** for who pulled/pushed what and when

---

#### Security Best Practices

- Use **TLS with trusted CAs**
- Rotate **credentials and certificates**
- Limit access using **firewalls and ACLs**
- Enable **image signing and verification** (Docker Content Trust or Notary)
- Set up **RBAC** with OAuth/LDAP if required

---

#### Conclusion

A custom Docker registry gives you full control over how container images are stored, accessed, and deployed. Whether you're supporting internal dev teams or deploying in production, building a secure and scalable registry helps improve reliability, meet compliance goals, and reduce dependency on third-party services.

By integrating TLS, authentication, storage backends, and scaling strategies, you can operate a registry that's truly **enterprise-ready**.
