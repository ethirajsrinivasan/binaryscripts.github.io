Ruby, known for its elegant syntax and developer-friendly features, hides a powerful engine under the hood. Understanding Ruby's internals, specifically method lookup and caching mechanisms, can lead to more efficient code and better performance, especially in large-scale applications. In this post, we’ll explore how Ruby performs method lookup, how method caching works, and how you can leverage these internals for performance optimization.

### Method Lookup in Ruby

Ruby follows an object-oriented paradigm, and when a method is called on an object, Ruby needs to determine where to find that method. Ruby’s method lookup mechanism is a crucial part of this process. It determines the order in which classes and modules are searched to find the appropriate method.

#### The Lookup Path

When a method is invoked on an object, Ruby starts looking for the method in the following order:

1. **The Object's Class**: Ruby first checks if the method is defined directly in the object's class.
2. **Superclasses**: If the method isn't found in the class, Ruby checks the class’s superclass and continues up the inheritance chain until it reaches `Object` (the base class of all Ruby objects).
3. **Included Modules**: If the method isn’t found in the class or any of its superclasses, Ruby looks at any modules included in the class. Ruby follows the inclusion order, searching modules in the order they were included.
4. **Method Aliasing and `method_missing`**: If Ruby doesn’t find the method via the typical lookup process, it checks if the class has defined a `method_missing` method, which can dynamically handle method calls not found by the lookup path.

This method lookup chain is managed using a **method lookup table (MLT)**, which caches the method resolution path to improve performance.

#### Example of Method Lookup

```ruby
module M
def foo
"foo from M"
end
end

class A
include M

def foo
"foo from A"
end
end

class B < A
def bar
"bar from B"
end
end

b = B.new
puts b.foo  # Output: "foo from A"
```

In the example above, when we call `b.foo`, Ruby first looks for the method in class `B`, then in class `A` (since `B` inherits from `A`), and finally in the module `M`. Ruby will return the first method it finds, so `"foo from A"` is printed.

### Caching Method Lookup

Ruby optimizes method lookup through a process called **method caching**, where it remembers the method lookup path after it is determined the first time. This caching mechanism ensures that repeated method calls on the same object are resolved faster, as Ruby does not need to perform the entire lookup process on every invocation.

#### How Method Caching Works

Ruby stores the method lookup path in a cache. When a method is first invoked, Ruby performs the lookup, finds the method, and then stores the result in the cache. On subsequent calls, Ruby can skip the lookup and directly invoke the cached method.

This cache is specific to each object and its class/module hierarchy. This means that if the class or modules change (e.g., a class is redefined or a new method is added dynamically), the cache is cleared, and Ruby will perform the lookup again.

#### Method Cache Example

```ruby
class A
def foo
puts "foo"
end
end

a = A.new
a.foo  # First call, method lookup occurs
a.foo  # Cached result, no lookup
```

In this example, the first time `a.foo` is called, Ruby performs the method lookup. On subsequent calls to `a.foo`, Ruby uses the cached lookup, skipping the search process, which improves performance.

#### Cache Invalidation

Ruby’s caching mechanism is smart enough to handle changes in the object’s class or modules. For example, if a method is added or removed, Ruby clears the relevant caches. This ensures that your application behaves correctly even after dynamic changes are made to the class hierarchy.

```ruby
class A
def foo
puts "foo"
end
end

a = A.new
a.foo  # "foo"

class A
def foo
puts "new foo"
end
end

a.foo  # "new foo" – the cache is invalidated
```

In this case, after redefining class `A` and changing the `foo` method, Ruby invalidates the cache and performs a fresh lookup.

### Performance Implications of Method Lookup and Caching

Understanding Ruby's method lookup and caching mechanism can help you write more efficient code, especially when working with large applications where performance matters.

#### 1. **Minimize Dynamic Method Lookup**
Dynamic method lookup can incur a performance penalty, especially if there are many classes and modules in the inheritance chain. To optimize, try to:
- Keep the class hierarchy simple.
- Avoid adding methods dynamically to classes at runtime.

#### 2. **Method Caching for Speed**
Ruby’s method caching improves performance by skipping repeated lookups. However, caching works best for methods that do not change frequently. If methods change dynamically, the cache will be invalidated, but frequent changes can still introduce performance overhead.

#### 3. **Avoid Unnecessary Method Missing**
While `method_missing` is a powerful tool, it comes with a performance cost. Since `method_missing` bypasses the regular method lookup path, it should be used sparingly. If performance is a priority, ensure that `method_missing` is only triggered for cases where methods are truly dynamic.

#### 4. **Use the `define_method` Cautiously**
Using `define_method` dynamically to create methods at runtime can be helpful but should be done with care. It bypasses Ruby's standard method lookup process, and excessive use can lead to performance degradation.

### Debugging and Inspecting Method Lookup

Ruby provides tools to inspect the method lookup path, which can be valuable for debugging and optimization. You can use `Method#source_location` and `Object#methods` to inspect the method source and the method list for objects.

```ruby
class A
def foo
"foo"
end
end

a = A.new
puts a.method(:foo).source_location  # Returns the file and line where foo is defined
```

This can be helpful when debugging issues related to method resolution and cache invalidation.

### Conclusion

Ruby's method lookup and caching mechanisms play a crucial role in determining how quickly methods are resolved and how efficiently your code runs. By understanding these internals, you can write more optimized Ruby code, avoid unnecessary performance penalties, and build scalable applications. Remember, simplicity in class design and strategic use of caching can go a long way in improving the performance of your Ruby applications.
