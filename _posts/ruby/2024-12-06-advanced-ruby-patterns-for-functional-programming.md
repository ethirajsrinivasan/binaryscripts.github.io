Ruby is often recognized for its object-oriented approach, but it also supports functional programming (FP) paradigms, allowing developers to leverage the benefits of both OOP and FP. Functional programming focuses on the use of pure functions, immutability, and higher-order functions, among other techniques.

In this post, we’ll explore advanced Ruby patterns that you can use to adopt functional programming principles in your codebase. We'll cover key concepts such as higher-order functions, immutability, currying, and function composition, showing how they can be applied to make your Ruby code cleaner, more maintainable, and easier to reason about.

### 1. **Higher-Order Functions in Ruby**

A higher-order function is a function that takes one or more functions as arguments or returns a function as a result. Ruby's flexibility allows you to easily work with higher-order functions using blocks, procs, and lambdas.

#### Example of Higher-Order Functions

Let's define a higher-order function that accepts a function and a value, and applies that function to the value:

```ruby
def apply_function(func, value)
func.call(value)
end

double = ->(x) { x * 2 }
puts apply_function(double, 4)  # Output: 8
```

In this example, `apply_function` is a higher-order function that takes the `double` lambda as a parameter and applies it to the number `4`. Ruby's support for first-class functions makes it easy to pass around lambdas and procs like any other object.

### 2. **Immutability in Ruby**

Immutability is a core concept in functional programming, where data cannot be modified after it's created. While Ruby doesn’t enforce immutability by default, you can implement immutable patterns to avoid side effects and maintain referential transparency.

#### Example of Immutability with Frozen Objects

In Ruby, you can use the `freeze` method to make objects immutable:

```ruby
person = { name: "Alice", age: 30 }
person.freeze

# Any attempt to modify the frozen object will raise an error
person[:name] = "Bob"  # Raises RuntimeError: can't modify frozen Hash
```

Using immutable data structures reduces bugs and makes your code easier to reason about. In the example above, attempting to modify the `person` hash raises an error due to the use of `freeze`.

### 3. **Currying in Ruby**

Currying is the process of transforming a function that takes multiple arguments into a sequence of functions that each take a single argument. Ruby supports currying, making it a powerful tool for building flexible and reusable functions.

#### Example of Currying in Ruby

Ruby’s lambdas and procs can be curried using the `curry` method:

```ruby
multiply = ->(a, b) { a * b }
curried_multiply = multiply.curry

# Apply arguments one by one
double = curried_multiply.call(2)
puts double.call(5)  # Output: 10
```

In this example, the `multiply` lambda is curried into a new function, which allows you to apply arguments one by one. Currying is especially useful in scenarios where you want to partially apply functions or delay the application of arguments.

### 4. **Function Composition in Ruby**

Function composition is the act of combining two or more functions to create a new function. In Ruby, this can be done by chaining methods together or using blocks to compose functions that operate on the same data.

#### Example of Function Composition

Let’s say we want to combine two simple functions: one that doubles a number and one that adds five:

```ruby
double = ->(x) { x * 2 }
add_five = ->(x) { x + 5 }

compose = ->(f, g) { ->(x) { f.call(g.call(x)) } }

double_and_add_five = compose.call(double, add_five)
puts double_and_add_five.call(3)  # Output: 16 (3 + 5 = 8, 8 * 2 = 16)
```

Here, the `compose` lambda takes two functions (`f` and `g`) and returns a new function that applies `g` first, then `f`. Function composition is a powerful tool for creating complex operations by combining simple functions.

### 5. **Using Enumerables to Embrace Functional Patterns**

Ruby's Enumerable module is designed with functional programming patterns in mind. It provides a wealth of methods such as `map`, `reduce`, `select`, and `reject` that allow you to work with collections in a functional manner.

#### Example Using `map`, `select`, and `reduce`

Let’s explore how you can use these methods to embrace functional programming principles:

```ruby
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Using map to transform the collection
doubled = numbers.map { |x| x * 2 }
puts doubled.inspect  # Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

# Using select to filter the collection
evens = numbers.select { |x| x.even? }
puts evens.inspect  # Output: [2, 4]

# Using reduce to accumulate a result
sum = numbers.reduce(0) { |acc, x| acc + x }
puts sum  # Output: 15
```

These methods allow you to work with collections in a functional way, making your code more declarative and concise.

### 6. **Lazy Evaluation in Ruby**

Ruby's `Enumerator::Lazy` allows for lazy evaluation, which is a functional programming concept where computations are deferred until the value is needed. This is useful for working with large datasets or streams of data, as it helps avoid unnecessary memory usage.

#### Example of Lazy Evaluation

Let’s say you want to generate a sequence of numbers, but only need a few results:

```ruby
lazy_numbers = (1..Float::INFINITY).lazy
first_five = lazy_numbers.select { |x| x.even? }.first(5)
puts first_five.inspect  # Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

In this example, the sequence is generated lazily, meaning that numbers are only computed when needed. This is more memory efficient, especially when working with infinite or large data streams.

### 7. **Using Functional Techniques in Rails**

Rails is traditionally an object-oriented framework, but you can apply functional programming principles in your Rails applications as well. For instance, you can use functional patterns like immutability, higher-order functions, and method chaining to improve the readability and maintainability of your code.

#### Example in Rails: Using Scopes for Composition

You can compose scopes in Rails to build more complex queries using functional patterns:

```ruby
class Post < ApplicationRecord
scope :published, -> { where(published: true) }
scope :recent, -> { where('created_at >= ?', 1.week.ago) }

# Compose scopes to get published and recent posts
def self.published_recent_posts
published.recent
end
end
```

Here, we composed two scopes to create a new scope that retrieves published and recent posts. This functional approach to query building keeps the code concise and modular.

### Conclusion

Ruby is a versatile language that can easily embrace functional programming patterns, offering a blend of object-oriented and functional paradigms. By leveraging advanced functional programming patterns such as higher-order functions, immutability, currying, and function composition, you can write more declarative, concise, and maintainable code.

These techniques are not only useful for improving code readability and reusability but can also lead to performance optimizations, particularly when working with collections or large datasets. By incorporating these functional programming patterns into your Ruby applications, you can create code that is both elegant and efficient.
