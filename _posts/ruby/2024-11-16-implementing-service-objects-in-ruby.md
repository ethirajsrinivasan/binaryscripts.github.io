Service objects are a proven design pattern in Ruby for encapsulating complex business logic. They help keep your controllers and models lean, promoting maintainability and clarity in your applications.

This post explores **how to implement service objects effectively**, ensuring your Ruby codebase remains modular and easy to extend.

### What Are Service Objects?

Service objects are plain Ruby objects (POROs) that encapsulate a specific piece of business logic. Instead of cluttering your models and controllers, service objects focus on a single responsibility, adhering to the **Single Responsibility Principle** (SRP) of clean architecture.

**Benefits of Service Objects:**

- Decouple business logic from models and controllers.
- Improve testability with isolated logic.
- Enhance readability by dividing complex workflows into smaller, manageable pieces.

---

### When to Use Service Objects

Use service objects when:

- A piece of logic doesn't belong directly in a model or controller.
- You have a workflow that spans multiple models or external services.
- You want to improve the readability and maintainability of your code.

Examples include:

- Payment processing
- File uploads
- Background job orchestration
- API integrations

### Anatomy of a Service Object

A service object typically consists of:

- **Initialization**: Accept required inputs as arguments.
- **Execution**: A public method (often `call`) that performs the logic.
- **Error Handling**: Clear handling of exceptions or errors.

Here’s a simple structure:

```ruby
class MyService
def initialize(arg1, arg2)
@arg1 = arg1
@arg2 = arg2
end

def call
# Business logic here
end
end
```

### Best Practices for Implementing Service Objects

#### 1. Focus on a Single Responsibility

Service objects should encapsulate only one piece of business logic. If you find yourself adding multiple responsibilities, it’s a sign that the service object should be split.

**Example: User Registration**
```ruby
class UserRegistrationService
def initialize(user_params)
@user_params = user_params
end

def call
user = User.create!(@user_params)
send_welcome_email(user)
user
end

private

def send_welcome_email(user)
UserMailer.welcome_email(user).deliver_now
end
end
```

#### 2. Use a Consistent Interface

Define a standard method (`call`) for executing the service. This ensures consistency and makes chaining service objects easier.

```ruby
result = MyService.new(arg1, arg2).call
```

#### 3. Handle Errors Gracefully

Use exceptions or custom error classes to handle failures cleanly.

```ruby
class MyService
def call
raise CustomError, "Something went wrong" unless valid_condition?

    # Logic here
end
end
```

#### 4. Avoid Dependency on External State

Service objects should be self-contained. Avoid accessing global variables or external dependencies directly.

Instead, pass all dependencies through the initializer:

```ruby
class PaymentProcessingService
def initialize(order, payment_gateway)
@order = order
@payment_gateway = payment_gateway
end

def call
@payment_gateway.charge(@order.total)
end
end
```

#### 5. Test Service Objects Independently

Isolated logic makes service objects highly testable. Write unit tests for service objects to validate their behavior without coupling to the rest of the application.

### Advanced Service Object Patterns

#### 1. Returning Results with a Service Result Object

Using a result object provides clarity when communicating success or failure.

```ruby
class Result
attr_reader :data, :error

def initialize(success:, data: nil, error: nil)
@success = success
@data = data
@error = error
end

def success?
@success
end
end

class UserRegistrationService
def call
user = User.create(@user_params)
return Result.new(success: false, error: "Validation failed") unless user.persisted?

    send_welcome_email(user)
    Result.new(success: true, data: user)
end
end
```

#### 2. Using Dry-Rb for Service Objects

The **dry-rb** ecosystem offers gems like `dry-monads` to simplify service object implementation with monads like `Result`.

```ruby
class UserRegistrationService
include Dry::Monads[:result]

def call(user_params)
user = User.create(user_params)
return Failure(:validation_failed) unless user.persisted?

    send_welcome_email(user)
    Success(user)
end
end
```

#### 3. Composing Service Objects

Chain multiple service objects together to handle complex workflows.

```ruby
class CheckoutService
def call(order_params)
order = CreateOrderService.new(order_params).call
ProcessPaymentService.new(order).call
SendConfirmationEmailService.new(order).call
end
end
```

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Overloading Responsibilities**: Avoid turning service objects into "god objects" by cramming multiple workflows into one class.
- **Skipping Tests**: Service objects are easy to test—leverage this advantage.
- **Skipping Documentation**: Document the purpose and interface of each service object for better team collaboration.

### Conclusion

Service objects in Ruby provide a clean and modular way to handle business logic. By adhering to the best practices outlined here, you can ensure your codebase remains maintainable, scalable, and testable. Whether you're building a small application or scaling for enterprise, service objects are an invaluable tool in your Ruby arsenal.
