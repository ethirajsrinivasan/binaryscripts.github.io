As data lakes evolve into **lakehouse architectures**, choosing the right table format becomes crucial for performance, reliability, and flexibility. Among the top contenders are **Apache Hudi**, **Delta Lake**, and **Apache Iceberg** — each designed to bring ACID transactions, schema evolution, and time-travel capabilities to modern big data platforms.

In this blog, we provide a **side-by-side comparison** of Hudi, Delta Lake, and Iceberg to help you choose the best solution based on your workload, infrastructure, and integration needs.

#### What Are Lakehouse Table Formats?

Lakehouse formats bring **database-like features** to object storage (e.g., HDFS, S3, GCS):

- **ACID transactions**
- **Efficient upserts and deletes**
- **Time travel and versioning**
- **Schema evolution**
- **Streaming + batch ingestion**
- **Partition and metadata management**

These formats decouple compute and storage while enabling reliable and performant querying across Spark, Presto, Hive, Flink, Trino, and more.
