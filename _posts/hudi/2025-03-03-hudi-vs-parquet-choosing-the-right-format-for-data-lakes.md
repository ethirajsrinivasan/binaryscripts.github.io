Choosing the right **file format** and **storage strategy** is critical for building scalable, cost-effective, and high-performance data lakes. Two of the most commonly used technologies in this space are **Apache Parquet** and **Apache Hudi**.

While **Parquet** is a columnar file format optimized for analytical workloads, **Hudi** is a data lake platform that supports versioning, upserts, and transactional capabilities on top of data formats like Parquet and ORC.

This article compares **Hudi vs. Parquet** in depth, helping you decide which is best for your **data lake architecture**.

#### What is Apache Parquet?

**Apache Parquet** is an open-source, columnar file format designed for efficient data storage and processing. It is widely used in Hadoop ecosystems and supported by engines like Spark, Hive, Presto, and Athena.

**Key features:**
- Columnar storage for high compression and fast scans
- Optimized for read-heavy workloads
- Schema evolution support
- Interoperable with multiple tools and languages

Parquet is **storage only** — it does not manage metadata, versioning, or transactions.

#### What is Apache Hudi?

**Apache Hudi (Hadoop Upserts Deletes and Incrementals)** is a data lake framework built to manage large-scale, mutable datasets. Hudi brings **transactional semantics** to data lakes by managing file versions, metadata, and commit timelines.

**Key features:**
- ACID-compliant upserts, inserts, and deletes
- Copy-on-Write (COW) and Merge-on-Read (MOR) storage options
- Incremental data ingestion and time-travel queries
- Hive and Glue metastore integration
- Built-in compaction and clustering

Hudi uses **Parquet** as the underlying file format for its base files.

#### When to Use Apache Parquet

Choose **Parquet** when:
- Your data is **append-only**
- You don’t need updates or deletes
- You want **simple storage** and **fast querying**
- You use Presto, Athena, or Redshift with no mutation requirements
- You don’t need to manage data lifecycle or versioning

Example use cases:
- Analytics on event logs
- Read-only datasets
- Periodic batch inserts

---

#### When to Use Apache Hudi

Choose **Hudi** when:
- You need **frequent updates**, deletes, or upserts
- You're building **real-time or streaming data pipelines**
- You want to support **time-travel queries**
- You need to process **incremental data**
- You want ACID guarantees over cloud object stores like S3

Example use cases:
- Change Data Capture (CDC) pipelines
- Real-time user tracking
- ETL for mutable datasets (e.g., inventory, orders)

---

#### Performance Considerations

- **Parquet** is simpler and faster for pure reads, especially when data is immutable.
- **Hudi** introduces some overhead for metadata management, compaction (in MOR), and commit timelines — but enables richer capabilities.
- Choose **Copy-on-Write** tables in Hudi for better read performance.
- Use **Merge-on-Read** for high-throughput writes with delayed compaction.

---

#### Coexistence Strategy

You can use **both Hudi and Parquet** in the same architecture:

- Use **Parquet** for raw/immutable layers (Bronze)
- Use **Hudi** for refined, enriched, or mutable datasets (Silver/Gold)
- This supports both **read-optimized queries** and **mutation-intensive pipelines**

---

#### Conclusion

Apache Hudi and Parquet serve different but complementary purposes in a modern data lake. While **Parquet** is ideal for **read-heavy, static data**, **Hudi** excels in managing **mutable, real-time datasets** with transactional integrity.

Use Parquet when simplicity and speed matter most, and choose Hudi when you need advanced capabilities like **upserts**, **incremental reads**, and **streaming ingestion** — especially for building reliable, ACID-compliant **data lakehouses**.
