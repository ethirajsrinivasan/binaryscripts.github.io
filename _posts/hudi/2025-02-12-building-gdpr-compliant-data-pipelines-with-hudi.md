excerpt: Learn how to build GDPR-compliant data pipelines using Apache Hudi. Implement delete handling, audit logging, record-level operations, and schema evolution while maintaining scalable data lakes.

With the enforcement of the **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**, organizations collecting personal data are now required to provide **user data access**, **auditing**, **rectification**, and **right to erasure**. Ensuring these capabilities in large-scale data lakes is not trivial.

**Apache Hudi** (Hadoop Upserts Deletes and Incrementals) is a modern lakehouse technology that provides **record-level operations**, **metadata tracking**, and **incremental querying** — making it an excellent choice for building **GDPR-compliant data pipelines**.

This guide explores how to use Hudi to meet GDPR requirements while maintaining scalability and performance in your big data architecture.

#### Key GDPR Requirements for Data Engineers

| GDPR Obligation                     | What It Means for Data Pipelines                           |
|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Right to Erasure (Article 17)      | Ability to **delete specific user records** on request     |
| Right to Rectification             | Ability to **update user data** across datasets            |
| Right to Access                    | Ability to **retrieve personal data** quickly              |
| Audit and Data Provenance          | Track **data access and modification history**             |
| Data Minimization                  | Store only what’s necessary, and **manage schema evolution**|

Hudi’s architecture allows developers to meet these requirements while optimizing for storage and compute.

#### Using Hudi’s Record-Level Deletes for Right to Erasure

GDPR requires that users have the ability to request deletion of their data — also known as **right to be forgotten**.

With Hudi, you can perform **record-level deletions** using the primary key.

```scala
val deleteDF = spark.read.json("/requests/delete.json")  // contains record keys

deleteDF.write.format("hudi")
.option("hoodie.table.name", "user_data")
.option("hoodie.datasource.write.operation", "delete")
.option("hoodie.datasource.write.recordkey.field", "user_id")
.option("hoodie.datasource.write.precombine.field", "ts")
.mode(SaveMode.Append)
.save("/user/hudi/user_data")
```

The deleted records are **physically removed during compaction** in Copy-On-Write (COW) or marked for deletion in Merge-On-Read (MOR).

---

#### Performing Rectification (Update) Requests

GDPR also requires users to be able to correct inaccurate data.

Use Hudi’s **upsert** operation:

```scala
val correctedDF = spark.read.json("/requests/rectify.json")

correctedDF.write.format("hudi")
.option("hoodie.datasource.write.operation", "upsert")
.option("hoodie.datasource.write.recordkey.field", "user_id")
.option("hoodie.datasource.write.precombine.field", "ts")
.mode(SaveMode.Append)
.save("/user/hudi/user_data")
```

Only records with **higher timestamps** (via `precombine.field`) will overwrite existing records.

---

#### Data Access and Retrieval for Subject Access Requests

When users request their stored data, you must provide **complete records** efficiently.

Use Hudi’s **incremental query capabilities** to scan relevant records:

```sql
SELECT * FROM hudi_user_data
WHERE user_id = 'user_1234';
```

Alternatively, run **point lookups** using Hudi’s Spark or Presto integrations.

---

#### Enabling Auditing and Data Provenance

Hudi provides **commit metadata**, **instant timestamps**, and **file-level history** which can be leveraged for auditing purposes.

Enable metadata tracking:

```properties
hoodie.metadata.enable=true
hoodie.metadata.async.enable=true
```

You can also use **Hive metastore** or **DeltaStreamer audit logs** to build an **audit trail** of when and how user data was modified.

Store metadata snapshots in a secure location and integrate with **Apache Atlas** or other data governance tools.

---

#### Schema Evolution for Data Minimization

Hudi supports **schema-on-write with evolution** — meaning you can drop unnecessary fields over time while maintaining backward compatibility.

For example, to drop deprecated personal fields:

1. Update the schema in your ingestion pipeline.
2. Use the `write.schema.evolution.enable=true` setting.

```properties
hoodie.write.schema.evolution.enable=true
hoodie.avro.schema.validate=true
```

This helps implement **data minimization** and ensures only necessary data is stored long term.

---

#### Automating GDPR Pipelines

Use **Apache Airflow**, **Nifi**, or **custom schedulers** to automate GDPR compliance workflows:

- Periodic deletion requests from a secure DB
- Ingest and rectify correction files
- Log every change in a data catalog

You can also define **DAGs** that track:

- Delete -> Archive -> Compact
- Rectify -> Update Hive table
- Access request -> Email / API return

---

#### Partitioning Strategies for Easier Erasure

Partitioning by identifiable fields (e.g., region, date, user type) makes GDPR operations faster:

```scala
.option("hoodie.datasource.write.partitionpath.field", "region")
```

Combine with **bucket index** or **global bloom index** for efficient lookup and delete.

---

#### Best Practices for GDPR Compliance with Hudi

- Use **Copy-On-Write** for cleaner record deletion
- Enable **metadata tables** for efficient access
- Store all GDPR requests in an auditable format
- Separate **hot and cold data** via time-based partitioning
- Perform **regular compaction and archival** for deleted records
- Ensure secure access via **Kerberos, Ranger, or Lake Formation**

#### Conclusion

Apache Hudi provides a strong foundation for **building GDPR-compliant data pipelines** in modern data lakes. With built-in support for **record-level deletions**, **upserts**, **schema evolution**, and **incremental queries**, Hudi enables organizations to meet data privacy obligations while maintaining performance and scalability.

By integrating Hudi with a governance-aware pipeline and following best practices, you can confidently support GDPR and other privacy regulations in your big data infrastructure.
