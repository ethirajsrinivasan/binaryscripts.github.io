Apache Hudi enables efficient **incremental data ingestion** and **real-time analytics** in data lakes. As your datasets evolve, managing **schema changes** becomes a critical part of maintaining stable, accurate, and performant pipelines.

In this post, we explore the **best practices for handling schema evolution in Hudi pipelines**, including field additions, type changes, compatibility strategies, Hive syncing, and metadata tracking — all while ensuring downstream query stability and data consistency.

#### What is Schema Evolution in Hudi?

Schema evolution allows **modifying the structure of a dataset** over time while retaining compatibility with existing records. In Hudi, this is primarily handled through:

- **Avro schemas** (used for reading and writing)
- **Hive schema syncing** (if Hive integration is enabled)
- **Schema validation and compatibility rules**

Common schema changes include:
- Adding new fields
- Changing data types
- Renaming or removing fields (advanced, riskier)

---

#### 1. Use Evolved Avro Schemas for Ingestion

All Hudi tables use **Avro format** for row-level serialization. The best way to manage schema evolution is to:

- Define a **base schema**
- Update the schema file as new fields are added
- Use this schema consistently across your ingestion tools (e.g., Spark, Flink)

Example Avro schema change (adding a nullable field):

```json
{
"name": "user_name",
"type": ["null", "string"],
"default": null
}
```

Using a **nullable field with a default** ensures backward compatibility.

---

#### 2. Enable Schema Validation in Hudi

Hudi can validate schema changes at write time to prevent breaking changes.

Enable this with:

```scala
.option("hoodie.avro.schema.validate", "true")
```

This enforces that the incoming schema is **backward compatible** with existing schema history.

---

#### 3. Manage Schema History with Metadata Table

Starting with Hudi 0.9.0+, schema evolution is tracked via the **metadata table**, which stores:

- Historical schemas
- Commit logs
- Table-level metadata (files, partitions, etc.)

Use:

```bash
hudi-cli
schema show --path /path/to/hudi/table
```

This helps in debugging or rolling back schema-related issues.

---

#### 4. Avoid Incompatible Type Changes

Changing column data types (e.g., `int` to `string`) may lead to corruption or query errors.

✅ Safe changes:
- Adding a field (nullable)
- Adding nested fields in a struct (with defaults)

❌ Risky changes:
- Changing type (`int` → `string`)
- Renaming or removing fields
- Changing nested field structure

Best practice: **version your schemas** and test downstream compatibility before deployment.

---

#### 5. Use Hive Sync for Schema Alignment

If you're syncing Hudi tables to Hive Metastore, make sure to update Hive schema during writes:

```scala
.option("hoodie.datasource.hive_sync.enable", "true")
.option("hoodie.datasource.hive_sync.support_timestamp", "true")
.option("hoodie.datasource.hive_sync.mode", "hms")
```

This ensures Hive reflects your evolved schema and avoids query mismatches.

---

#### 6. Partitioning and Schema Evolution

Avoid evolving schema in partition columns — it's not supported and can cause inconsistencies.

If your use case demands dynamic partitions, use **non-evolving fields** for partitioning:

```scala
.option("hoodie.datasource.write.partitionpath.field", "event_date")
```

Avoid nested fields or frequently updated columns as partition keys.

---

#### 7. Test with Schema Registry (Optional)

If you're using a schema registry (like Confluent or AWS Glue), register your Avro schemas and enforce compatibility rules.

This adds governance and automates schema checks at ingestion.

---

#### 8. Monitor with CLI and Tools

Use Hudi CLI for quick schema validation:

```bash
hudi-cli
connect --path /path/to/table
schema show
```

You can also integrate with monitoring tools to track:
- Schema mismatches
- Failed writes due to schema validation
- Hive syncing errors

---

#### Conclusion

Schema evolution is inevitable in fast-changing data pipelines. Apache Hudi makes it possible to manage these changes **safely and efficiently** — if you follow best practices around **schema validation**, **Avro compatibility**, **Hive integration**, and **metadata tracking**.

By designing your schemas carefully and evolving them with discipline, you can build long-lasting Hudi pipelines that support real-time analytics and complex transformations without breaking downstream systems.
