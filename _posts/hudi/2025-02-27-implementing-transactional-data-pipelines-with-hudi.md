Modern data engineering requires more than just batch ingestion and static datasets. Today’s platforms need **real-time updates**, **change data capture (CDC)**, and **reliable transactional semantics** to power machine learning, analytics, and business intelligence.

Enter **Apache Hudi** — a powerful data lakehouse engine that enables **ACID-compliant**, transactional pipelines on cloud-native storage like **Amazon S3**, **HDFS**, and **Azure ADLS**.

In this blog, we’ll walk through how to build **transactional data pipelines using Apache Hudi**, covering ingestion modes, write operations, compaction, incremental queries, and best practices for production systems.

---

#### What Makes a Pipeline Transactional?

A transactional pipeline provides:

- **Atomicity**: Data is either fully written or not at all
- **Consistency**: Reads see a consistent snapshot
- **Isolation**: Concurrent writes don’t interfere
- **Durability**: Once committed, data persists

Hudi brings these ACID guarantees to data lakes by managing **file versions**, **write markers**, and **commit logs** internally.

---

#### Key Features of Apache Hudi for Transactions

- **Upserts and Deletes**: Update or remove records like a database
- **Merge-on-Read (MOR)** and **Copy-on-Write (COW)** storage models
- **Instant-based timeline**: Guarantees data consistency across writers
- **Compaction and clustering**: Maintain performance over time
- **Incremental queries**: Process only new or updated data

---

#### Choosing the Right Write Operation

Hudi supports multiple operations:

| Operation    | Use Case                                |
|--------------|------------------------------------------|
| `insert`     | Append-only data                         |
| `upsert`     | New + updated data (CDC use cases)       |
| `delete`     | Remove records by primary key            |
| `bulk_insert`| Fast first-time loads without merging    |

Example PySpark:

```python
df.write.format("hudi") \
.option("hoodie.datasource.write.operation", "upsert") \
.option("hoodie.table.name", "users") \
.option("hoodie.datasource.write.recordkey.field", "user_id") \
.option("hoodie.datasource.write.precombine.field", "updated_at") \
.mode("append") \
.save("s3://my-data-lake/hudi/users")
```

---

#### Building the Transactional Pipeline

1. **Ingest Data**  
   From Kafka, CDC tools (e.g., Debezium), or logs into Spark/Flink/Glue.

2. **Apply Transformations**  
   Enrich, filter, or join with reference datasets.

3. **Write to Hudi Table**  
   Use upsert/delete modes with proper keys and timestamps.

4. **Sync with Hive/Glue Catalog**  
   Enable Hudi’s metadata sync to make tables queryable via Presto, Athena, or Hive.

5. **Query for Increments**  
   Downstream jobs read only changed records using incremental reads.

---

#### Enabling Incremental Queries

You can process only new data since the last commit:

```python
spark.read.format("hudi") \
.option("hoodie.datasource.query.type", "incremental") \
.option("hoodie.datasource.read.begin.instanttime", "20240101000000") \
.load("s3://my-data-lake/hudi/users")
```

This drastically improves performance for ETL pipelines and CDC handling.

---

#### Compaction and Clustering

In **Merge-on-Read** tables, updates are logged in delta files and compacted later.

Enable inline compaction:

```properties
hoodie.compact.inline=true  
hoodie.compact.inline.max.delta.commits=5
```

Or run async compaction with schedulers like Airflow or AWS Glue workflows.

Clustering improves file sizing and query performance:

```properties
hoodie.clustering.inline=true  
hoodie.clustering.plan.strategy.sort.columns=updated_at
```

---

#### Ensuring Pipeline Reliability

- **Enable metadata table** for faster file listing
- Monitor commit timeline and rollback states
- Use deduplicated `recordkey` + `precombine` field to resolve conflicts
- Track ingestion using `HoodieTimeline` and `HoodieCommitMetadata`

---

#### Best Practices

- Prefer **COW** for frequent reads, **MOR** for heavy writes
- Align `recordkey`, `precombine`, and partitioning with data model
- Tune file sizes and commit frequency for S3 I/O efficiency
- Use **Hive sync mode = glue** for AWS-native integration
- Schedule **compaction and cleaning** to avoid small file issues

---

#### Conclusion

Apache Hudi enables modern data teams to build **transactional data pipelines** that scale with the volume, velocity, and variety of today’s data. With support for **real-time upserts**, **incremental processing**, and **time-travel capabilities**, Hudi turns your data lake into a lakehouse — without compromising on ACID guarantees.

Implementing these practices will help you create reliable, efficient, and future-proof pipelines ready for production analytics and machine learning.
