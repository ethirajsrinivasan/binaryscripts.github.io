Modern data lakes are increasingly **multi-tenant**, serving multiple teams, departments, or clients from a shared platform. These tenants often have unique **data isolation, access control, and schema** requirements. To support such complexity, data lake engines must offer **scalable ingestion**, **transactional guarantees**, and **flexible query access**.

**Apache Hudi** has emerged as a key component in multi-tenant lakehouse architectures. With its support for **ACID transactions**, **schema evolution**, **incremental processing**, and **time-travel**, Hudi empowers organizations to build **secure, governed, and real-time multi-tenant data lakes**.

In this blog, we explore how Hudi supports multi-tenancy, what benefits it provides, and best practices for designing tenant-aware pipelines and storage strategies.

#### What Is a Multi-Tenant Data Lake?

A **multi-tenant data lake** allows different tenants (teams, apps, clients) to:
- Ingest and access data **independently**
- Maintain **schema isolation**
- Share the same **underlying infrastructure**
- Enforce **role-based access and audit controls**

This setup enables **cost efficiency**, **governance**, and **collaborative analytics** without deploying separate clusters for each tenant.

---

#### How Hudi Supports Multi-Tenancy

Apache Hudi offers several features that align with multi-tenant design patterns:

1. **Namespace Isolation via Partitioning or Table Paths**
2. **ACID Transactions for Safe Concurrent Writes**
3. **Incremental Views for Tenant-Specific Pipelines**
4. **Schema Evolution and Compatibility**
5. **Metadata Table for Scalable File Listing**
6. **Time Travel for Auditability and Rollback**

---

#### Tenant Isolation Patterns in Hudi

There are multiple ways to isolate tenant data in Hudi:

**1. Table-Level Isolation**
Each tenant has a separate Hudi table:
```
/data/hudi/tenant_a/events
/data/hudi/tenant_b/events
```

Pros:
- Clean separation
- Easy access control using storage-level policies

Cons:
- Metadata fragmentation
- Harder to optimize across tenants

**2. Partition-Level Isolation**
Use a `tenant_id` or `org_id` field as the partition key:

```python
df.write.format("hudi")
.option("hoodie.datasource.write.partitionpath.field", "tenant_id")
.save("/data/hudi/multi_tenant_events")
```

Pros:
- Better storage utilization
- Single metadata index

Cons:
- More complex access control and compaction management

**3. Column-Based Filtering**
Store all data in one table and enforce row-level filters using access control tools like Ranger or lakehouse query engines.

---

#### Schema Evolution Per Tenant

Hudi supports **schema-on-write** with **evolution capabilities**, allowing:
- Addition of new columns
- Safe handling of optional/nullable fields
- Backward and forward compatibility (if configured)

This is essential in multi-tenant environments where schemas evolve independently.

To enable schema evolution:
```properties
hoodie.avro.schema.validate=false
hoodie.avro.schema.allow.auto.evolution=true
```

---

#### Incremental Query Support

Tenants may require isolated views of newly ingested data.

Use Hudi’s **incremental pull** to stream updates per tenant:

```python
df = spark.read.format("hudi")
.option("hoodie.datasource.query.type", "incremental")
.option("hoodie.datasource.read.begin.instanttime", "20240416120000")
.load("/data/hudi/multi_tenant_events")

tenant_data = df.filter("tenant_id = 'tenant_b'")
```

This enables tenant-specific pipelines that avoid scanning historical data.

---

#### Compaction and Metadata Scaling

Multi-tenant setups often lead to:
- Many small files (per partition/tenant)
- High compaction overhead
- Metadata growth

**Recommendations:**
- Enable the metadata table:
  ```
  hoodie.metadata.enable=true
  ```
- Use **asynchronous compaction** for Merge-on-Read:
  ```
  hoodie.compact.inline=false
  ```
- Run **partition-aware clustering** to group small files by tenant

---

#### Access Control and Governance

Hudi integrates with:
- **AWS Lake Formation**
- **Apache Ranger**
- **Unity Catalog (Databricks)**

Use these tools to:
- Enforce row-level security by `tenant_id`
- Restrict access to specific table paths
- Monitor tenant-specific usage for billing or auditing

---

#### Best Practices for Multi-Tenant Hudi Deployments

- Design tenant-aware **record keys**:  
  ```
  tenant_id:event_id
  ```

- Use **partition pruning** for efficient reads
- Apply **per-tenant retention policies**
- Enable **Hive/Glue sync** for metadata consistency
- Monitor write performance per tenant
- Consider **Z-ordering or clustering** for multi-dimensional tenant access

---

#### Conclusion

Apache Hudi provides powerful capabilities that make it a natural fit for **multi-tenant data lakes**. With native support for **transactional ingestion**, **schema evolution**, and **incremental processing**, Hudi ensures each tenant's data remains **isolated**, **queryable**, and **governed**.

By applying the right partitioning, schema, and access control strategies, organizations can deliver scalable and secure lakehouse experiences — all on top of a shared Hudi-powered architecture.
