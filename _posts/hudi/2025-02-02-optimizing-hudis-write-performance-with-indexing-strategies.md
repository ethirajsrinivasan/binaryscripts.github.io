**Apache Hudi** has become a cornerstone of modern data lakes and lakehouse architectures by supporting **incremental ingestion**, **upserts**, **streaming ETL**, and **record-level updates** on top of HDFS or cloud object stores.

But writing to Hudi, especially in upsert-heavy workloads, can become a bottleneck if not configured properly. One of the most effective ways to boost Hudi's write performance is by using the **right indexing strategy**.

In this blog, we’ll explore various **Hudi indexing techniques**, how they work, and how to **tune them for better write throughput and consistency**.

---

#### Why Indexing Matters in Hudi

During upserts, Hudi must **locate existing records** to determine whether to update or insert. This requires an efficient indexing mechanism.

Without an optimized index, every write may trigger:
- Excessive **file lookups**
- Slower commit times
- Higher memory usage
- Performance degradation under large datasets

#### Types of Indexes in Apache Hudi

Apache Hudi supports multiple indexing types, each optimized for different workloads.

| Index Type   | Lookup Cost | Write Cost | Update Performance | Use Case |
|--------------|-------------|------------|---------------------|----------|
| **Bloom**    | Medium      | Low        | Good                | Default, general use |
| **HBase**    | Low         | High       | Excellent           | High-frequency updates |
| **Simple**   | High        | Low        | Poor                | Small datasets |
| **Global_Bloom** | Medium | Medium     | Fair                | Updates across partitions |
| **Bucket**   | Low         | Medium     | Excellent           | Pre-partitioned writes |
| **Record-Level Index** | Varies | Varies | Varies           | Advanced use cases (Beta) |

Let’s explore the most commonly used ones in more detail.

---

#### Bloom Index (Default)

The **Bloom index** is the default and most widely used. It leverages **Bloom filters** embedded in Parquet files to check for record keys.

```properties
hoodie.index.type=BLOOM
hoodie.bloom.index.parallelism=200
hoodie.bloom.index.filter.type=dynamic_v0
```

**Pros:**
- No external system required
- Fast lookups for moderate-scale datasets

**Cons:**
- Slower on large datasets with wide partitions
- False positives may slightly increase update overhead

**Tuning Tips:**
- Adjust `hoodie.bloom.index.parallelism`
- Reduce false positives via `hoodie.bloom.index.filter.type`

---

#### Global Bloom Index

Global Bloom extends regular Bloom across all partitions.

```properties
hoodie.index.type=GLOBAL_BLOOM
```

**Use case:** When record keys may move across partitions.

**Trade-off:** More expensive lookups across all files but ensures data correctness in dynamic partitioning scenarios.

---

#### HBase Index

Uses Apache HBase as an external store for indexing.

```properties
hoodie.index.type=HBASE
hoodie.index.hbase.zkquorum=zk-host:2181
hoodie.index.hbase.zkport=2181
```

**Pros:**
- Very fast lookups even with large datasets
- Ideal for **high update frequency**

**Cons:**
- Requires external HBase cluster
- Operational overhead

Use in production environments that prioritize **low-latency updates**.

---

#### Simple Index

Performs full file scans to find matching keys. Best for **small or testing datasets**.

```properties
hoodie.index.type=SIMPLE
```

**Not recommended** for large datasets due to poor scalability.

---

#### Bucket Index (Stable in Hudi 0.11+)

The **bucket index** precomputes record distribution, similar to bucketing in Hive.

```properties
hoodie.index.type=BUCKET
hoodie.bucket.index.num.buckets=16
```

**Pros:**
- Deterministic write path
- Efficient for **bulk inserts** and **streaming**

**Cons:**
- Less flexible for dynamic partitioning
- Requires upfront tuning of bucket count

Best for **deduplicated streams** or when primary key distribution is predictable.

---

#### Tips for Optimizing Write Performance

- Use **Bulk Insert** mode (`bulk_insert`) for initial ingestion
- Enable **metadata table** for file listing acceleration:
  ```properties
  hoodie.metadata.enable=true
  ```
- Use **async compaction** (`scheduleAndExecuteCompaction`) in MOR tables
- Cache partition paths when using Bloom:
  ```
  hoodie.bloom.index.use.caching=true
  ```
- For Spark pipelines, optimize parallelism:
  ```properties
  hoodie.bloom.index.parallelism=300
  hoodie.upsert.shuffle.parallelism=300
  ```

#### Choosing the Right Index

| Use Case                                | Recommended Index |
|----------------------------------------|-------------------|
| General upsert workload                | Bloom             |
| Records updating across partitions     | Global Bloom      |
| High-frequency updates                 | HBase             |
| Streaming pipeline with known skew     | Bucket            |
| Testing or small-scale ingestion       | Simple            |

Always benchmark with **representative data volumes and write patterns** before choosing.

#### Conclusion

Apache Hudi's ability to perform **efficient upserts and incremental writes** relies heavily on the indexing mechanism used. By selecting the right **indexing strategy** and tuning it properly, you can **maximize ingestion throughput**, **minimize lookup cost**, and ensure **consistency across your data lake**.

Whether you're building a real-time pipeline or onboarding historical data, Hudi’s flexible indexing framework gives you the tools to fine-tune performance and reliability in high-scale environments.
