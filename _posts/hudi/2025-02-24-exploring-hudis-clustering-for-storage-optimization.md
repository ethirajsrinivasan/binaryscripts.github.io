As data lakes scale, the **small files problem** and **poor data organization** can drastically affect performance and cost. Apache Hudi addresses this challenge through **clustering**, a storage optimization feature that **reorganizes data files** for improved query performance and reduced metadata overhead.

This blog explores how Hudi's **clustering** works, when to use it, and how to configure it effectively to improve the **performance, manageability, and efficiency** of your data lake storage.

#### What is Clustering in Apache Hudi?

**Clustering** in Hudi is a process that **reorganizes data files** based on defined criteria such as sort order or file size. It helps:

- Combine small files into larger ones
- Organize files for better query performance
- Optimize partition layout without rewriting full tables

Unlike **compaction** (which rewrites delta logs into base files in Merge-on-Read), **clustering** is available for **both COW and MOR** tables and targets **file organization**.

---

#### Why Use Clustering?

Benefits of clustering:
- **Improves query scan performance** by reducing file count and enabling sorted access
- **Reduces metadata size and S3/DFS list cost**
- Maintains **query performance** in long-running ingestion pipelines
- Avoids the overhead of table rewrite or re-partitioning

Common triggers:
- After many incremental upserts or writes
- Following ingestion bursts creating many small files
- Periodic table optimization for analytics

---

#### How Clustering Works

Clustering works in two stages:

1. **Scheduling clustering plans**  
   Marks partitions that need reorganization

2. **Executing clustering plans**  
   Launches Spark jobs to rewrite data into new files based on sort and size strategies

It is **non-blocking** and can be run asynchronously alongside ingestion jobs.

#### Configuring Clustering in Hudi

To enable clustering:

```properties
hoodie.clustering.inline=true
hoodie.clustering.inline.max.commits=4
hoodie.clustering.plan.strategy.class=org.apache.hudi.client.clustering.plan.strategy.SparkSizeBasedClusteringPlanStrategy
hoodie.clustering.execution.strategy.class=org.apache.hudi.client.clustering.run.strategy.SparkSortAndSizeExecutionStrategy
hoodie.clustering.target.file.max.bytes=134217728  # 128MB
hoodie.clustering.sort.columns=event_ts
```

**Inline clustering** runs automatically after `N` commits (configured by `inline.max.commits`).

To **schedule clustering manually**:

```bash
spark-submit hudi-cli.jar --command "clustering schedule --base-path s3://bucket/path"
```

To **execute scheduled clustering**:

```bash
spark-submit hudi-cli.jar --command "clustering run --base-path s3://bucket/path"
```

---

#### Clustering Strategies

1. **Size-based Clustering**  
   Combines small files into optimal-size chunks

2. **Sort and Size Clustering**  
   Sorts records by column(s) before rewriting (e.g., by `event_ts`)

3. **Custom Clustering**  
   You can implement your own strategy by extending Hudi’s clustering interfaces

---

#### Monitoring Clustering Jobs

Use the **Hudi CLI** to check clustering plans and status:

```bash
hoodie-cli
> connect --path s3://your-table
> clustering show schedule
> clustering show run
```

In logs, look for:
- Number of small files compacted
- Partitions clustered
- Duration and size improvements

---

#### Query Performance Improvements

Clustering improves:
- **Athena and Presto scan performance**
- **Hive and Spark pushdowns**
- **Column pruning and partition filtering**

Especially beneficial for:
- Append-heavy workloads (logs, events)
- Partitioned tables with high ingestion frequency
- Long-running datasets in COW mode

---

#### Best Practices

- Use **inline clustering** for continuous optimization in streaming jobs
- For batch pipelines, use **scheduled clustering** during off-peak hours
- Choose **sort columns** aligned with query filters (e.g., `event_ts`, `region`)
- Monitor table size and plan clustering after every **X commits or Y GB written**
- Use **compaction for MOR**, clustering for **COW/MOR file layout optimization**

---

#### Conclusion

Hudi's clustering feature provides an elegant way to keep your data lake **organized, performant, and storage-efficient** without full rewrites. By applying clustering strategies based on size and sort order, you can tame the small files problem, accelerate queries, and simplify storage management — all critical in maintaining production-grade data lakes at scale.

Whether you're running on-premise HDFS or S3-based lakehouses, clustering is a must-have for long-term Hudi optimization.
