Managing secrets like API keys, passwords, and certificates securely is a critical challenge in Kubernetes environments. While Kubernetes provides a native **Secrets** resource, it has limitations in terms of encryption, access control, and audit capabilities. To address these gaps, integrating **HashiCorp Vault** with Kubernetes offers a robust solution for secrets management. This article explores how to leverage Vault alongside Kubernetes native mechanisms for **secure and scalable secrets management** in production-grade clusters.

#### Why Native Kubernetes Secrets May Not Be Enough

Kubernetes Secrets are stored in etcd and by default are **base64-encoded but not encrypted** unless you enable encryption at rest. Additionally, Kubernetes Secrets:

- Lack fine-grained access control beyond namespace scoping.
- Provide limited auditing for secret access.
- Are static and require manual rotation.

These limitations make Kubernetes Secrets insufficient for high-security environments requiring dynamic secrets and compliance controls.

#### Introducing HashiCorp Vault

**Vault** is a secrets management tool designed for dynamic secrets, encryption as a service, and tight access controls. It supports features like:

- Dynamic secret generation (e.g., database credentials).
- Fine-grained policies controlling secret access.
- Audit logging for all secret interactions.
- Automatic secrets rotation and leasing.

When integrated with Kubernetes, Vault can dynamically inject secrets into Pods, minimizing static secret exposure.

#### Kubernetes and Vault Integration Overview

##### Authentication with Kubernetes Service Accounts

Vault supports Kubernetes authentication by trusting the Kubernetes API server tokens attached to Pods. The integration flow involves:

1. Vault is configured to trust the Kubernetes cluster CA and the service account JWT.
2. A Kubernetes Pod requests a Vault token using its service account token.
3. Vault validates the token and returns a Vault token scoped with policies defining secret access.

##### Injecting Secrets into Pods

Two popular methods for delivering Vault secrets to Kubernetes workloads are:

- **Vault Agent Injector:** Sidecar container automatically injects secrets as files or environment variables.
- **Init Containers:** An init container fetches secrets from Vault before the main container starts.

This ensures secrets are dynamically retrieved at runtime, eliminating static secrets baked into container images or manifests.

#### Step-by-Step Example: Configuring Vault with Kubernetes

1. **Enable Kubernetes Auth in Vault**

```bash
vault auth enable kubernetes
```

2. **Configure the Kubernetes Auth method**

```bash
vault write auth/kubernetes/config \
    token_reviewer_jwt="$(cat /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token)" \
    kubernetes_host="https://$KUBERNETES_PORT_443_TCP_ADDR:443" \
    kubernetes_ca_cert=@/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/ca.crt
```

3. **Create a Vault policy defining access**

```hcl
path "secret/data/myapp/*" {
  capabilities = ["read"]
}
```

4. **Bind the policy to a Kubernetes service account**

```bash
vault write auth/kubernetes/role/myapp-role \
    bound_service_account_names=myapp-sa \
    bound_service_account_namespaces=default \
    policies=myapp-policy \
    ttl=24h
```

5. **Deploy your application Pod with Vault annotations**

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: myapp
  annotations:
    vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject: "true"
    vault.hashicorp.com/role: "myapp-role"
    vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-secret-config: "secret/data/myapp/config"
spec:
  serviceAccountName: myapp-sa
  containers:
  - name: myapp-container
    image: myapp:latest
```

This setup dynamically fetches secrets and injects them into the Pod without hardcoding sensitive data.

#### Kubernetes Native Secrets Encryption

While Vault provides a powerful external secrets manager, it is recommended to **enable encryption at rest for Kubernetes Secrets** as an additional layer:

- Configure `EncryptionConfiguration` on the API server.
- Use AES-CBC or AES-GCM providers.
- Rotate encryption keys regularly.

This protects native Secrets stored in etcd from unauthorized access.

#### Best Practices for Secure Secrets Management in Kubernetes

- **Prefer dynamic secrets** from Vault over static secrets.
- Use **short-lived tokens and leases** to minimize exposure.
- Implement **RBAC policies** tightly scoped to least privilege.
- Enable **audit logging** on Vault and Kubernetes API server.
- Regularly **rotate secrets and encryption keys**.
- Use **network policies** to restrict access to Vault and Kubernetes API.

#### Common Challenges and Troubleshooting

- **Token validation failures:** Ensure Vault trusts Kubernetes CA and service account tokens.
- **Secrets not injected:** Check Vault Agent Injector logs and Pod annotations.
- **Access denied:** Verify Vault policies and Kubernetes RBAC bindings.
- **Latency issues:** Optimize Vault performance or cache secrets if needed.

#### Conclusion

Combining **HashiCorp Vault** with Kubernetes native Secrets provides a robust, scalable, and secure secrets management strategy. This hybrid approach balances the ease of Kubernetes Secrets with Vaultâ€™s dynamic capabilities and fine-grained control. Mastering this integration empowers DevOps and security teams to safeguard sensitive data effectively across cloud-native environments.
