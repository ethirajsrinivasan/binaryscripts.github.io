excerpt: Considering a move from Apache Kafka to Apache Pulsar? Learn the core migration challenges and practical strategies to transition workloads safely while maintaining reliability, performance, and compatibility.
---
With the growing demand for **multi-tenancy**, **geo-replication**, and **separation of compute and storage**, many organizations are exploring a migration from **Apache Kafka** to **Apache Pulsar**. While Pulsar offers architectural advantages — including built-in multi-tenancy and better scaling — migration from an established Kafka setup involves careful planning and execution.

This guide outlines the **challenges**, **compatibility concerns**, and **strategic approaches** required to transition smoothly from Kafka to Pulsar without disrupting production systems.

---

#### Why Migrate from Kafka to Pulsar?

Organizations consider migrating due to:

- **Decoupled architecture** (compute vs. storage)
- Built-in **multi-tenancy** and **RBAC**
- **Geo-replication** support out-of-the-box
- **Tiered storage** for cost-effective long-term retention
- Native support for **stream + queue** models

However, Kafka has a mature ecosystem. Migrating away requires ensuring **feature parity**, **data continuity**, and **minimal downtime**.

---

#### Key Migration Challenges

##### 1. **Topic and Partition Mapping**
Kafka topics are partitioned log files; Pulsar topics are partitioned at the namespace level.

- Challenge: Kafka's topic partition layout may not map directly to Pulsar
- Strategy: Match Kafka partition counts using Pulsar’s `numPartitions` config

##### 2. **Data Format Compatibility**
Kafka messages may be in Avro, JSON, or Protobuf with Kafka-specific schemas.

- Challenge: Pulsar uses its own schema registry
- Strategy: Use schema translation tools or flatten messages during migration

##### 3. **Consumer Semantics**
Kafka consumers rely on offset tracking; Pulsar uses **cursor positions**.

- Challenge: Aligning offset-based tracking with Pulsar cursors
- Strategy: Use **Kafka-on-Pulsar (KoP)** for compatibility during transition

##### 4. **Ordering Guarantees**
Kafka provides **partition-level ordering**; Pulsar supports this with **Key_Shared** subscription.

- Challenge: Matching ordering guarantees for critical consumers
- Strategy: Use Key_Shared or ensure consistent hashing in producer key assignment

##### 5. **Rewriting Clients and APIs**
Kafka APIs differ from Pulsar APIs.

- Challenge: Client migration can be time-intensive
- Strategy: Use KoP or Pulsar Kafka Wrapper for step-by-step migration

---

#### Migration Strategies

##### Strategy 1: Kafka-on-Pulsar (KoP) for Incremental Migration

**KoP** is a Pulsar protocol handler that allows Kafka clients to interact with Pulsar brokers as if they were Kafka brokers.

- Kafka clients work without modification
- Enables hybrid deployments
- Ideal for brownfield migrations

```bash
bin/pulsar-daemon start protocol-handler kafka
# Then configure listeners on port 9092
```

##### Strategy 2: Dual Writes (Kafka → Pulsar)

Write to both Kafka and Pulsar during a cutover period.

- Allows testing Pulsar consumers without disrupting Kafka
- Ensures data consistency validation
- Eventually, cut off Kafka ingestion

Tools:
- Kafka Connect → Pulsar Sink
- MirrorMaker → Pulsar Sink Connectors

##### Strategy 3: Mirror Kafka Topics to Pulsar

Use connectors to mirror Kafka topics to Pulsar:

- **Pulsar IO Kafka source**
- **Kafka Connect Pulsar Sink**

Sample config for Kafka → Pulsar:

```json
{
"tenant": "public",
"namespace": "default",
"topicName": "mirrored-topic",
"kafkaConsumerConfigs": {
"bootstrap.servers": "kafka-broker:9092",
"group.id": "kafka-mirror-group"
}
}
```

##### Strategy 4: Full Cutover (Lift-and-Shift)

Move entire producer/consumer applications to Pulsar APIs and infrastructure.

- High risk, but clean migration
- Use when Kafka is no longer required
- Requires significant refactoring

---

#### Testing and Validation

Before go-live:

- Validate **message volume**, **latency**, and **ordering**
- Compare **message lag**, **throughput**, and **error rates**
- Use **end-to-end checksum tagging** for data consistency
- Monitor using **Prometheus**, **Grafana**, or **Pulsar Manager**

---

#### Operational Considerations

- Set up **topic partitions and namespaces** equivalent to Kafka layout
- Apply appropriate **retention**, **TTL**, and **compaction** policies
- Use **TLS and token-based authentication** for secure migration
- Implement **alerts** for lag, failures, and broker overload

---

#### Best Practices

- Start with non-critical topics to test migration flow
- Run in **dual-write mode** until consumer reliability is verified
- Use **schema validation tools** to ensure cross-system compatibility
- Enable **debug logging** in consumers to trace mismatches or delays
- Document **offset-to-cursor mapping** for rollback purposes

---

#### Conclusion

Migrating from Kafka to Pulsar is a strategic shift that unlocks modern capabilities like **tiered storage**, **native multi-tenancy**, and **protocol unification**. However, success depends on thoughtful planning, hybrid strategies like KoP or dual writes, and robust testing.

By understanding the **architectural differences** and using tools like **Pulsar IO connectors**, **Kafka-on-Pulsar**, and **schema translators**, teams can minimize risk and move confidently toward a more scalable and flexible event streaming infrastructure.
