excerpt: Discover the key architectural and performance differences between Apache Kafka and Apache Pulsar for building scalable, high-volume data streaming systems.
---
As organizations scale their data infrastructure to support real-time applications, the need for reliable and high-performance streaming platforms becomes critical. **Apache Kafka** and **Apache Pulsar** are two of the most popular open-source platforms used to handle **high-throughput, low-latency streaming data**.

While both are built for event-driven architectures, their **architectures, scalability models, and feature sets differ significantly**. This article compares **Kafka and Pulsar** in the context of **high-volume streaming**, helping you make an informed choice for your data pipeline.

#### Kafka and Pulsar: A Quick Overview

**Apache Kafka**
- Developed at LinkedIn, open-sourced via Apache Foundation
- Widely adopted for real-time data pipelines and stream processing
- Monolithic architecture with tight coupling between brokers and storage

**Apache Pulsar**
- Created at Yahoo, now an Apache project
- Built for cloud-native, geo-replicated, and multi-tenant systems
- Decoupled architecture with separate brokers and storage (Apache BookKeeper)

#### Architectural Comparison

| Feature                      | Apache Kafka                         | Apache Pulsar                              |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Storage Model**            | Log storage managed by brokers        | Storage handled by BookKeeper nodes         |
| **Scalability**              | Add partitions and brokers            | Scale brokers and Bookies independently     |
| **Geo-Replication**          | External (MirrorMaker)                | Built-in and asynchronous                   |
| **Multi-Tenancy**            | Not native, hard to isolate           | Native with namespace, tenant isolation     |
| **Topic Abstraction**        | Partition = File = Thread             | Topics are lightweight; segment-based       |
| **Message Queuing**          | Stream-only                           | Stream + Queue hybrid                       |

Kafka's simpler design is easier to manage initially but can become complex at scale. Pulsarâ€™s modular architecture is optimized for elasticity and multi-tenancy.

#### Throughput and Latency

**Kafka**
- Extremely high throughput
- Optimized for sequential disk I/O
- Needs tuning for network, partitions, and replication

**Pulsar**
- Comparable throughput with lower latency out-of-the-box
- Write-ahead logs in BookKeeper offer high concurrency
- Handles millions of topics efficiently due to topic segmentation

---

#### Durability and Message Retention

| Feature                  | Apache Kafka                     | Apache Pulsar                       |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Durability**           | Broker writes + replication      | BookKeeper ledger replication       |
| **Retention Options**    | Time-based, size-based           | Time-based, size-based, backlog-aware |
| **TTL / Per-Consumer**   | Global per-topic                 | Per-subscription TTL and expiry     |

Pulsar offers more granular **retention and expiration policies**, allowing better control in multi-tenant scenarios.

---

#### Message Consumption Models

**Kafka**
- Pull-based consumer model
- Relies on consumer group coordination
- Simple offset tracking with at-least-once guarantees

**Pulsar**
- Push and pull-based models
- Supports multiple subscription types:
  - Exclusive
  - Shared
  - Failover
- Built-in **dead letter queues**, **retry topics**, and **ack timeouts**

Pulsar is more flexible for **asynchronous**, **distributed**, and **microservice-based** architectures.

#### Ecosystem and Tooling

| Category           | Kafka                             | Pulsar                             |
|--------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Stream Processing** | Kafka Streams, ksqlDB              | Flink, Pulsar Functions, Spark     |
| **Connectors**     | Kafka Connect                       | Pulsar IO, Debezium, custom sink/source |
| **Observability**  | JMX, Prometheus exporters           | Built-in Prometheus + Grafana      |
| **Admin Tools**    | Confluent Control Center, Kafka UI  | Pulsar Manager, Pulsar Admin CLI   |

Kafka has a more **mature ecosystem**, while Pulsar offers **modern integrations** and cloud-native design patterns.

#### Deployment and Operations

- **Kafka** is relatively easier to set up initially but requires **Zookeeper** (until KRaft is mature) and careful partition management.
- **Pulsar** has more components (Broker, BookKeeper, ZooKeeper) but scales **more linearly** at high volumes.

Pulsar offers:
- **Multi-datacenter replication**
- **Topic-level isolation**
- **Automatic topic compaction and TTL cleanup**

Kafka relies more on external tools for similar functionality.

#### When to Choose Kafka

- You already use Kafka and require ecosystem tools like Kafka Streams
- You prefer a simpler, single-cluster setup
- Your workload is focused on **streaming-only patterns**
- You rely on well-supported commercial offerings (e.g., Confluent)

---

#### When to Choose Pulsar

- You need **multi-tenancy**, **geo-replication**, or **hybrid messaging**
- You plan to handle **millions of topics** or high-concurrency workloads
- You want to scale storage and compute independently
- You prefer **cloud-native**, containerized deployment models

---

#### Conclusion

Both Kafka and Pulsar are excellent choices for building high-volume streaming systems, but they solve the problem in different ways.

- Kafka provides **simplicity**, **strong community support**, and **proven reliability**
- Pulsar offers **architectural flexibility**, **fine-grained control**, and **cloud-native scalability**

Choose Kafka when you need a battle-tested solution with mature tooling, and choose Pulsar when building for **elastic scale**, **geo-distribution**, or **complex multi-tenant environments**.

Ultimately, your decision should align with your **performance goals**, **team expertise**, and **long-term architectural needs**.
