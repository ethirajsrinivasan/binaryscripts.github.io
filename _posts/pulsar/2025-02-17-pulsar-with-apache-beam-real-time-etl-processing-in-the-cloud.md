excerpt: Discover how Apache Pulsar integrates with Apache Beam to enable real-time ETL processing in the cloud. Learn how to build scalable, serverless data pipelines that ingest, transform, and deliver data at low latency.

Modern data pipelines require the ability to process and transform events in **real time** with low latency, high scalability, and cloud-native flexibility. While **Apache Pulsar** serves as a powerful messaging backbone with built-in multi-tenancy and geo-replication, **Apache Beam** provides a unified model for defining batch and streaming ETL jobs that can run on multiple execution engines.

In this post, we explore how to use **Apache Pulsar with Apache Beam** to implement **cloud-native, real-time ETL pipelines**, enabling organizations to stream, enrich, and load data into analytical systems efficiently.

#### Why Pulsar + Apache Beam?

| Feature                     | Apache Pulsar                     | Apache Beam                        |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Messaging Engine            | Distributed pub-sub, queue, and topic storage | Streaming/batch data processing model |
| Strengths                   | Multi-tenancy, geo-replication, tiered storage | Unified model, portability, advanced transforms |
| Use Case                    | Event ingestion and transport     | Transformation, enrichment, windowing |
| Cloud Native                | Yes (K8s-ready, serverless Pulsar Functions) | Yes (runs on Dataflow, Flink, Spark) |

Together, Pulsar and Beam allow for a decoupled, end-to-end **streaming ETL system** with flexibility and fault tolerance.

This architecture supports:
- Real-time ingestion and transformation
- Stateless or stateful operations
- Pluggable runners (Flink, Spark, Google Dataflow)
- Dynamic scalability and error recovery

#### Reading from Pulsar in Apache Beam

Apache Beam supports reading from Pulsar using community connectors or through Pulsar IO integration.

Sample pipeline to read from Pulsar:

```java
PulsarIO.Read<String> pulsarRead = PulsarIO.read()
.withServiceUrl("pulsar://pulsar-broker:6650")
.withAdminUrl("http://pulsar-admin:8080")
.withTopic("persistent://public/default/transactions")
.withSubscriptionName("beam-subscription")
.withSchema(Schema.STRING);

Pipeline pipeline = Pipeline.create(options);

pipeline
.apply("ReadFromPulsar", pulsarRead)
.apply("TransformData", ParDo.of(new TransformFn()))
.apply("WriteToSink", ...);
```

Note: Use a compatible runner such as **Apache Flink**, **Google Dataflow**, or **Spark** to execute the pipeline in a streaming context.

---

#### Transforming Data with Beam

Use Beam’s **ParDo**, **Windowing**, and **GroupByKey** APIs to apply ETL logic:

```java
static class TransformFn extends DoFn<String, KV<String, Integer>> {
@ProcessElement
public void processElement(ProcessContext c) {
String line = c.element();
// Example transformation
String key = extractKey(line);
c.output(KV.of(key, 1));
}
}
```

For time-based aggregation:

```java
.apply(Window.<KV<String, Integer>>into(FixedWindows.of(Duration.standardMinutes(5))))
.apply(Sum.integersPerKey())
```

---

#### Writing Output to Cloud Sinks

Beam supports writing to:
- **BigQuery**
- **Google Cloud Storage (GCS) / S3**
- **Apache Hudi or Iceberg**
- **JDBC / NoSQL stores**

Example: Writing to BigQuery

```java
.apply("ToTableRow", MapElements.into(TypeDescriptor.of(TableRow.class))
.via((KV<String, Integer> kv) -> new TableRow().set("user", kv.getKey()).set("count", kv.getValue())))
.apply("WriteToBQ", BigQueryIO.writeTableRows()
.to("project:dataset.table")
.withSchema(schema)
.withWriteDisposition(WRITE_APPEND));
```

---

#### Deployment on Cloud

You can run Beam pipelines on:
- **Google Cloud Dataflow** (managed, serverless)
- **Apache Flink on Kubernetes**
- **EMR with SparkRunner**

Use CI/CD for pipeline versioning and integrate with **Pulsar Functions or IO connectors** for managed I/O handling.

---

#### Monitoring and Error Handling

Monitor:
- Pulsar message lag with Prometheus/Grafana
- Beam job metrics on your runner’s UI (Dataflow/Flink Dashboard)
- Throughput and retries

Use:
- **Dead-letter queues (DLQs)** in Pulsar
- **Retry mechanisms** in Beam (DoFn with try/catch or side outputs)

---

#### Best Practices

✅ Use **schema validation** (Avro/Protobuf) in Pulsar  
✅ Deploy **Beam pipelines as containers** for portability  
✅ Apply **windowing and watermarks** for accurate aggregation  
✅ Monitor **Pulsar topic lag** and **Beam job health**  
✅ Use **Stateful DoFns** for session-based processing  
✅ Scale Beam pipelines dynamically with runner configs

---

#### Conclusion

By combining **Apache Pulsar** and **Apache Beam**, you can build flexible, cloud-native ETL pipelines that process and deliver data in real time. Pulsar ensures durable, scalable messaging, while Beam provides a powerful programming model for transformation and enrichment.

Together, they enable modern streaming architectures that are **resilient**, **scalable**, and **future-proof** — perfect for cloud-native, real-time analytics platforms.
