As businesses increasingly rely on real-time data platforms, **high availability (HA)** and **fault tolerance** become critical requirements for any messaging system. **Apache Pulsar**, a distributed pub-sub messaging platform, is architected with multi-layered resilience in mind — but to fully leverage its capabilities, careful configuration and operational planning are essential.

This post explores how to **optimize Pulsar** for **high availability and fault tolerance**, including deployment architectures, broker replication, BookKeeper tuning, and best practices for operational reliability.

#### Pulsar’s Built-In Architecture for HA

Pulsar separates concerns across distinct components:

- **Pulsar Brokers**: Handle client connections and metadata
- **Apache BookKeeper**: Stores the actual message data in ledgers
- **ZooKeeper**: Manages cluster coordination and service discovery

This separation allows Pulsar to:
- Scale storage independently
- Achieve high message durability via replicated ledgers
- Support transparent broker failover

#### Key High Availability Features

| Feature                    | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **ReplicationFactor**      | Replicates message ledgers across multiple Bookies                          |
| **Persistent Subscriptions** | Ensure message delivery even after broker or client restarts               |
| **Geo-Replication**        | Replicates topics across clusters and regions for disaster recovery         |
| **Load Balancing**         | Brokers dynamically assign topics to spread traffic                        |
| **Dead Letter Topics**     | Retain undeliverable messages for retry and auditing                        |

#### Broker Configuration for HA

Ensure Pulsar brokers are set up with:

```yaml
loadBalancerEnabled: true
loadBalancerPlacementStrategy: least_loaded
loadBalancerAutoBundleSplitEnabled: true
loadBalancerAutoUnloadSplitBundlesEnabled: true
loadBalancerSheddingEnabled: true
```

This configuration helps:
- Distribute bundles evenly across brokers
- Automatically rebalance traffic in case of node failure
- Prevent hotspots from overwhelming single brokers

---

#### BookKeeper Replication Settings

Critical for fault tolerance:

```yaml
managedLedgerDefaultEnsembleSize=3
managedLedgerDefaultWriteQuorum=3
managedLedgerDefaultAckQuorum=2
```

Explanation:
- **Ensemble size**: Number of Bookies used per ledger
- **Write quorum**: Number of Bookies written to per entry
- **Ack quorum**: Minimum Bookies that must acknowledge to consider a write successful

This ensures that data is not lost even if one Bookie fails.

---

#### Zookeeper for Metadata Consistency

Zookeeper is the backbone for:
- Cluster coordination
- Metadata management
- Leader elections

Best practices:
- Deploy **Zookeeper in an odd-sized ensemble** (3 or 5 nodes)
- Monitor **Zookeeper latency and election churn**
- Protect against **split-brain scenarios** with quorum-based writes

---

#### Enabling Geo-Replication for Disaster Recovery

Pulsar supports **built-in geo-replication** between clusters:

```bash
bin/pulsar-admin namespaces set-replicas my-tenant/my-ns --clusters us-west,us-east
```

Configure each cluster to accept replication:

```bash
bin/pulsar-admin clusters create us-west --url http://us-west-pulsar:8080
bin/pulsar-admin clusters create us-east --url http://us-east-pulsar:8080
```

Messages published to a topic in one region will replicate to all others, enabling **multi-region failover**.

---

#### Monitoring and Recovery Tools

Use Pulsar Manager or Prometheus/Grafana to monitor:

- **Broker health** and throughput
- **BookKeeper ledger replication status**
- **Backlog growth and consumer lag**
- **ZooKeeper session state**

Alert on:
- Bookie disk failures
- Broker JVM heap spikes
- Ledger replication lag
- Namespace unavailability

Enable **auto-recovery** and **bookie autorecovery daemon** to rebuild lost replicas.

---

#### Handling Broker and Bookie Failures

- Brokers are stateless — failed brokers can be restarted or replaced easily
- Bookies can be added/removed dynamically — Pulsar redistributes traffic automatically
- Use `pulsar-admin bookies list-bookies` to validate quorum health
- Re-replicate under-replicated ledgers:

```bash
bin/bookkeeper shell autorecovery
```

---

#### Best Practices

- Use **separate disks** for journal and ledger storage in BookKeeper
- Isolate Pulsar components on different machines or containers
- Enable **message deduplication** to avoid duplication during retries
- Set **message TTLs and backlog limits** to prevent resource exhaustion
- Regularly test **failover scenarios** in staging environments

---

#### Conclusion

Apache Pulsar offers a rich, resilient architecture designed for high availability and fault tolerance. But to realize these benefits, it's important to configure **replication, quorum, geo-replication, and broker balancing** thoughtfully.

By following the practices in this post, you can ensure that your Pulsar cluster is not only performant but also **resilient to node failures, network partitions, and regional outages** — making it ready for production-grade, mission-critical event streaming workloads.
