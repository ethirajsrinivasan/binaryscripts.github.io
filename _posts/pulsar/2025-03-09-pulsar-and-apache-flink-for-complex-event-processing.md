In industries like finance, e-commerce, cybersecurity, and IoT, detecting meaningful patterns in streams of events — such as fraud attempts, system anomalies, or user journeys — is critical. This is where **Complex Event Processing (CEP)** comes in.

By combining **Apache Pulsar** for **real-time messaging** with **Apache Flink** for **stateful stream processing**, you can build powerful CEP pipelines that are scalable, fault-tolerant, and capable of handling massive volumes of data with low latency.

This post explores how to use **Pulsar and Flink together for CEP**, covering integration methods, pattern recognition, windowing, and deployment tips.

#### Why Combine Pulsar and Flink?

Apache Pulsar provides:

- High-throughput, low-latency pub-sub messaging
- Multi-tenancy and geo-replication
- Tiered storage and decoupled compute-storage

Apache Flink offers:

- Stateful stream processing with exactly-once semantics
- Complex event pattern recognition using **Flink CEP**
- Time-based windowing, joins, and aggregations

Together, they create a real-time analytics stack capable of **consuming, enriching, detecting, and acting on events** in milliseconds.

#### Integrating Pulsar with Flink

Apache Flink supports Pulsar through an official **source and sink connector** (as of Flink 1.14+).

**Add Pulsar Connector Dependency:**

```xml
<dependency>
<groupId>org.apache.flink</groupId>
<artifactId>flink-connector-pulsar</artifactId>
<version>3.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

#### Example: CEP with Flink + Pulsar

Suppose you want to detect users who **add an item to cart but never complete a purchase within 10 minutes**.

##### Define a CEP pattern:

```java
Pattern<Event, ?> pattern = Pattern.<Event>begin("addToCart")
.where(e -> e.getType().equals("ADD_TO_CART"))
.followedBy("noPurchase")
.where(e -> e.getType().equals("PURCHASE"))
.not()
.within(Time.minutes(10));
```

##### Apply the pattern to Pulsar stream:

```java
DataStream<Event> eventStream = env
.fromSource(
PulsarSourceBuilder.<Event>builder()
.setServiceUrl("pulsar://localhost:6650")
.setAdminUrl("http://localhost:8080")
.setTopic("user-events")
.setDeserializationSchema(new EventDeserializationSchema())
.build(),
WatermarkStrategy.noWatermarks(),
"PulsarSource"
);

PatternStream<Event> patternStream = CEP.pattern(eventStream, pattern);

patternStream
.select(new PatternSelectFunction<Event, Alert>() {
public Alert select(Map<String, List<Event>> pattern) {
return new Alert("Potential abandoned cart detected!");
}
})
.addSink(new PulsarSink<>());
```

#### Use Cases for Pulsar + Flink CEP

- **Fraud Detection**: Identify out-of-pattern transaction sequences
- **Cybersecurity**: Detect login anomalies or privilege escalations
- **E-Commerce**: Track customer funnels and cart abandonment
- **IoT Monitoring**: Trigger alerts on abnormal sensor sequences
- **Network Analytics**: Detect usage spikes or packet anomalies

---

#### Best Practices

- Use **Key_Shared subscriptions** in Pulsar for parallel Flink consumption
- Enable **event time processing** with proper watermarking
- Partition Pulsar topics to match Flink parallelism
- Store Flink checkpoints in **DFS or cloud storage** for recovery
- Tune **buffer timeout**, **state backend**, and **parallelism** for low-latency

---

#### Monitoring and Observability

Monitor Pulsar and Flink using:

- **Pulsar Metrics** (Prometheus + Grafana)
- **Flink Dashboard** (job graph, task metrics, throughput)
- **Custom alerts** on pattern detection output topics

Ensure that backpressure, latency, and checkpoint health are continuously tracked.

---

#### Conclusion

Combining **Apache Pulsar** and **Apache Flink** allows you to implement sophisticated **real-time complex event processing pipelines** with high fault tolerance, scalability, and low operational overhead.

Whether you're processing financial transactions, IoT telemetry, or e-commerce behavior patterns, this integration offers the tools you need to **detect insights, anomalies, and opportunities in motion** — not after the fact.
