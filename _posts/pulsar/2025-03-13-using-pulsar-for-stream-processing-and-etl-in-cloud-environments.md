As businesses move to the cloud and embrace **real-time data architectures**, traditional batch ETL systems are no longer sufficient. Apache Pulsar, a cloud-native messaging and event streaming platform, offers a powerful foundation for building **scalable, real-time ETL** and **stream processing pipelines** in the cloud.

In this blog, we’ll explore how to leverage **Apache Pulsar** for stream processing and ETL workloads across modern cloud platforms. We’ll cover integration patterns, architecture components, and deployment best practices for building reliable, scalable data pipelines.

#### Why Pulsar for Cloud-Based ETL and Stream Processing?

Apache Pulsar offers key advantages for ETL and real-time analytics in the cloud:

- **Multi-tenancy** for organizing ETL jobs by team or application
- **Built-in geo-replication** for hybrid/multi-cloud architectures
- **Decoupled compute and storage** for independent scaling
- **Serverless Pulsar Functions** for inline transformation
- Native support for **streaming and queuing workloads**

These features make Pulsar ideal for cloud-based ETL, where elasticity and fault tolerance are critical.

#### Pulsar in a Cloud ETL Architecture

[Pulsar Functions / Flink / Spark / NiFi / Beam]
↓
[Transformed Pulsar Topics or Data Sinks]

[Cloud Storage / Databases / Data Warehouses]
```

Apache Pulsar acts as the **data backbone**, decoupling ingestion from transformation and storage.

#### Ingesting Data with Pulsar IO

**Pulsar IO** provides built-in connectors for **ingesting from** and **writing to** external systems.

Examples:
- **Sources**: JDBC, Kafka, MQTT, AWS S3, Kinesis
- **Sinks**: Elasticsearch, Cassandra, BigQuery, Redshift, Snowflake

To deploy a JDBC source connector:

```bash
bin/pulsar-admin sources create \
--archive pulsar-io-jdbc-source.nar \
--tenant public \
--namespace default \
--name mysql-source \
--destination-topic-name db-events \
--source-config-file mysql-config.yaml
```

This makes Pulsar ideal for **change data capture (CDC)** and ingesting events from cloud-native sources.

#### Real-Time Transformation with Pulsar Functions

**Pulsar Functions** are lightweight, serverless compute units that run within Pulsar and apply real-time transformations to streaming data.

Example: Convert temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius

```python
def convert_temp(input, context):
data = json.loads(input)
data['temp_c'] = (data['temp_f'] - 32) * 5 / 9
return json.dumps(data)
```

Deploy via CLI or REST:

```bash
bin/pulsar-admin functions create \
--tenant public \
--namespace default \
--name temp-converter \
--inputs temp-fahrenheit \
--output temp-celsius \
--py convert_temp.py \
--classname convert_temp
```

Pulsar Functions reduce ETL latency and infrastructure overhead by processing events in-stream.

#### Advanced ETL with Flink, Spark, and Beam

For complex workflows, integrate Pulsar with powerful stream processors:

- **Apache Flink**: Use `pulsar-flink-connector` for windowed aggregations and joins
- **Apache Spark Structured Streaming**: Use `pulsar-spark` to read/write topics
- **Apache Beam**: Run ETL pipelines across GCP, AWS, or Kubernetes

Example Flink job to count messages per device:

```java
DataStream<String> stream = env
.addSource(new PulsarSource<>(...));

stream
.map(record -> extractDeviceId(record))
.keyBy(id -> id)
.window(TumblingProcessingTimeWindows.of(Time.minutes(1)))
.sum("count")
.addSink(new PulsarSink<>(...));
```

---

#### Writing to Cloud Sinks

You can push transformed data to cloud-native sinks:

- **Amazon S3 / GCS** for raw and transformed logs
- **BigQuery / Redshift / Snowflake** for analytics
- **Elasticsearch** for real-time search and dashboards
- **PostgreSQL / DynamoDB** for enriched operational data

Example: Writing to S3 via Pulsar IO

```yaml
awsS3BucketName: my-bucket
awsRegion: us-east-1
fileFormat: json
compressionType: gzip
batchSize: 500
```

---

#### Cloud-Native Deployment Options

You can deploy Pulsar on:

- **Kubernetes** via [Pulsar Helm Charts](https://github.com/apache/pulsar-helm-chart)
- **Confluent Cloud** or **StreamNative Cloud**
- **Amazon EKS**, **GKE**, or **AKS** for managed cloud orchestration
- **Serverless Functions** (Pulsar Functions or AWS Lambda via sink connectors)

Use **Helm** to install Pulsar in minutes:

```bash
helm repo add apache https://pulsar.apache.org/charts
helm install pulsar apache/pulsar --set initialize=true
```

---

#### Best Practices

- Partition topics by tenant or workload type to isolate pipelines
- Use **Key_Shared subscriptions** for parallel processing with ordering
- Monitor processing lag and throughput with Prometheus/Grafana
- Apply **backpressure handling** in Flink/Spark to prevent memory overload
- Enable **TLS + token-based auth** to secure ETL pipelines end-to-end

---

#### Conclusion

Apache Pulsar is a powerful platform for enabling **real-time stream processing and ETL** in modern cloud environments. Its modular architecture, rich ecosystem, and seamless integration with external systems make it ideal for building **low-latency, cloud-native data pipelines**.

Whether you’re streaming CDC data to BigQuery or transforming logs before indexing in Elasticsearch, Pulsar provides the scalability and reliability required for modern cloud-scale ETL.
