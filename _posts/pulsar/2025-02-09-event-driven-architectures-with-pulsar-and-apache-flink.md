excerpt: Discover how to integrate Apache Pulsar with Apache Flink to build powerful event-driven architectures. Learn patterns for ingestion, transformation, and stateful stream processing across distributed systems.

Modern applications need to process events in **real time** to power use cases like fraud detection, personalization, operational analytics, and IoT data processing. This is where **event-driven architectures (EDA)** come into play — enabling systems to react to events as they happen.

Two open-source technologies stand out in this space:
- **Apache Pulsar**: a cloud-native, multi-tenant messaging platform
- **Apache Flink**: a powerful framework for **stateful stream processing**

In this post, we explore how **Apache Pulsar and Flink** can be integrated to build scalable, fault-tolerant **event-driven architectures**.

#### Why Combine Pulsar and Flink?

| Apache Pulsar                                | Apache Flink                             |
|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Durable, scalable event messaging             | Distributed stateful stream processing    |
| Native multi-tenancy, geo-replication         | Complex event processing, windowing       |
| Built-in support for pub/sub and queues       | Event time semantics and state management |
| Decouples producers and consumers             | SQL, CEP, and DataStream APIs             |

Together, Pulsar and Flink enable:
- Ingestion of events from many sources
- Real-time stream processing and analytics
- Stateless or stateful transformations
- Output to data lakes, databases, or dashboards

#### Setting Up Pulsar with Flink

Use **Apache Flink's Pulsar connector** to consume and produce events from Pulsar.

Add Maven dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
<groupId>org.apache.flink</groupId>
<artifactId>flink-connector-pulsar</artifactId>
<version>1.16.0</version>
</dependency>
```

Example Pulsar source in Flink (Java):

```java
PulsarSource<String> source = PulsarSource.builder()
.setServiceUrl("pulsar://localhost:6650")
.setAdminUrl("http://localhost:8080")
.setStartCursor(StartCursor.earliest())
.setTopics("events.input")
.setDeserializationSchema(new SimpleStringSchema())
.build();

StreamExecutionEnvironment env = StreamExecutionEnvironment.getExecutionEnvironment();

DataStream<String> stream = env.fromSource(source, WatermarkStrategy.noWatermarks(), "Pulsar Source");

stream
.map(event -> "Processed: " + event)
.print();

env.execute("Pulsar + Flink Stream");
```

#### Common Use Cases

1. **Real-time Analytics**
  - Aggregate clickstream data per minute/hour
  - Detect anomalies or patterns
  - Use Flink SQL or CEP for analysis

2. **Event Enrichment**
  - Join incoming events with reference data
  - Enhance payloads before storage

3. **Data Routing and Filtering**
  - Route to different sinks based on attributes
  - Drop noisy events or enrich alerts

4. **Machine Learning Inference**
  - Score events in real-time using a preloaded model
  - Output results to Pulsar or database

---

#### Stateful Processing with Flink

Flink allows **keyed state**, **windowed joins**, and **timers** for complex logic:

```java
stream
.keyBy(event -> extractKey(event))
.window(TumblingEventTimeWindows.of(Time.minutes(5)))
.reduce((e1, e2) -> combine(e1, e2));
```

This makes it ideal for use cases like:
- Sessionization
- Fraud detection
- Metric aggregation

---

#### Writing Back to Pulsar from Flink

Use **PulsarSink** for Flink to send processed results back to Pulsar topics:

```java
PulsarSink<String> sink = PulsarSink.builder()
.setServiceUrl("pulsar://localhost:6650")
.setAdminUrl("http://localhost:8080")
.setTopic("events.output")
.setSerializationSchema(new SimpleStringSchema())
.build();

stream.sinkTo(sink);
```

---

#### Deployment Strategies

- **Flink on Kubernetes** for scaling and isolation
- **Pulsar in multi-tenant mode** to support different apps
- Use **Pulsar Functions** for lightweight stream logic
- Secure Flink-Pulsar connection with **TLS and auth tokens**

---

#### Monitoring and Reliability

✅ Use **Flink checkpoints** for fault-tolerance  
✅ Monitor Pulsar consumer lag with **Prometheus**  
✅ Use **dead-letter topics** in Pulsar for poison events  
✅ Tune parallelism and task slots for throughput  
✅ Use **state backends** (e.g., RocksDB) for large-scale state management

---

#### Conclusion

By combining the **messaging reliability** of Apache Pulsar with the **processing power** of Apache Flink, you can build modern, scalable, and fault-tolerant **event-driven architectures** that respond to data in real time.

Whether you're building fraud detection systems, real-time dashboards, or personalized user experiences — Pulsar and Flink give you the tools to stream, process, and react to data like never before.
