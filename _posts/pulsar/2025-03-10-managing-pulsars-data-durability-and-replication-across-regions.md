In distributed messaging systems, **data durability and cross-region replication** are vital for maintaining availability, consistency, and disaster recovery. Apache Pulsar is designed with **built-in support for persistence and geo-replication**, making it ideal for modern, cloud-native deployments where global resilience is a must.

This guide explains how to manage **Pulsar’s data durability guarantees** and set up **multi-region replication** for high-availability and disaster-resilient architectures.

#### Understanding Pulsar's Durability Architecture

Apache Pulsar separates its **serving layer (Brokers)** from the **storage layer (BookKeeper)**. This allows fine-grained control over message durability and redundancy.

Key components:
- **Brokers** handle client connections and topic routing
- **Bookies (Apache BookKeeper)** persist messages to disk
- **ZooKeeper** coordinates metadata and cluster state

Durability is ensured through **write-ahead logs**, **replication across bookies**, and **acknowledgment strategies**.

---

#### Configuring Message Durability

Set the replication factor to control how many copies of each message are stored:

```conf
managedLedgerDefaultEnsembleSize=3
managedLedgerDefaultWriteQuorum=3
managedLedgerDefaultAckQuorum=2
```

**Definitions**:
- **Ensemble size**: Number of bookies a message is written to
- **Write quorum**: Number of bookies a write must go to
- **Ack quorum**: Number of successful writes needed to acknowledge

To improve durability:
- Increase ensemble and quorum sizes
- Use SSD-backed or provisioned IOPS volumes
- Configure journal and ledger directories on separate disks

---

#### Enabling Synchronous Replication

Pulsar supports **synchronous replication** within a region using BookKeeper’s quorum writes. You can configure message acknowledgment behavior per producer:

```java
Producer<byte[]> producer = client.newProducer()
.topic("persistent://public/default/critical-events")
.sendTimeout(5, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
.blockIfQueueFull(true)
.enableBatching(false)
.create();
```

To ensure stronger consistency:
- Disable batching for low-latency durable writes
- Set low send timeout to handle retries

---

#### Geo-Replication Across Regions

Pulsar offers **built-in geo-replication** to synchronize topics across clusters in different regions.

##### Step 1: Define Replication Clusters

Each region runs a separate Pulsar cluster with a unique name:

```bash
bin/pulsar-admin clusters create us-east \
--url http://us-east-broker:8080 \
--broker-url pulsar://us-east-broker:6650

bin/pulsar-admin clusters create eu-west \
--url http://eu-west-broker:8080 \
--broker-url pulsar://eu-west-broker:6650
```

##### Step 2: Register Clusters in Tenant

Assign both clusters to a tenant:

```bash
bin/pulsar-admin tenants update my-tenant \
--allowed-clusters us-east,eu-west
```

##### Step 3: Enable Replication for Namespace

```bash
bin/pulsar-admin namespaces set-clusters my-tenant/global-namespace \
--clusters us-east,eu-west
```

Messages published in one region will be **replicated to other clusters automatically**.

---

#### Best Practices for Replication Strategy

- Use **global topics** to route traffic automatically to the nearest region
- Ensure **symmetric configurations** across clusters (auth, TLS, retention)
- Monitor **replication lag** using `pulsar_replication_backlog` and related metrics
- Place clusters behind **region-aware load balancers** to reduce client latency
- Use **Kafka-on-Pulsar** for bridging legacy systems during migration

---

#### Handling Failures and Disaster Recovery

If a region becomes unavailable:

- Consumers in other regions can **seamlessly switch** to their local cluster
- Replicated messages ensure no data loss during failover
- Producers can write to the next available cluster in the namespace list

To strengthen DR:
- Regularly test failover scenarios
- Use **tiered storage** to recover long-term data
- Automate cluster health checks and replication alerts

---

#### Conclusion

Apache Pulsar makes it easy to ensure **durability and resilience at global scale**, thanks to its **write-quorum architecture** and **built-in geo-replication**. Whether you’re supporting financial transactions, IoT telemetry, or mission-critical analytics, Pulsar helps guarantee that **your data is protected and always available—even across regions**.

By tuning durability parameters and replicating data across distributed clusters, teams can build modern, fault-tolerant systems that meet the demands of real-time applications.
