excerpt: Learn how to streamline data ingestion using Apache Pulsar and Kafka Connect. Discover how to integrate diverse data sources with Pulsar using Kafka-compatible connectors for building robust streaming pipelines.

Modern data systems rely on ingesting large volumes of data from diverse sources—databases, logs, cloud services, and sensors. To handle this complexity at scale, tools like **Apache Pulsar** and **Kafka Connect** provide extensible frameworks for **streamlined, real-time ingestion**.

In this post, you'll learn how to use **Apache Pulsar with Kafka Connectors** to build **modular and scalable data ingestion pipelines**, leveraging Kafka Connect's rich ecosystem of connectors with Pulsar's cloud-native messaging architecture.

#### Why Combine Pulsar with Kafka Connect?

While Pulsar has its own native connector framework (**Pulsar IO**), integrating it with **Kafka Connect** offers:

- **Access to 100+ pre-built connectors** (Debezium, JDBC, Elasticsearch, etc.)
- Easy integration with enterprise systems and cloud services
- Consistent data pipeline architecture
- Minimal custom code

This hybrid approach enables organizations to ingest from virtually any source directly into Pulsar topics.

#### Architecture Overview

```
[Source Systems (DB, REST, MQ)]
↓
[Kafka Connect with Source Connectors]
↓
[Apache Pulsar Sink Connector]
↓
[Pulsar Topics → Stream Processing / Analytics / ML]
```

You can also do the reverse—sink data from Pulsar into other systems using Kafka-compatible sink connectors.

#### Setting Up Kafka Connect with Pulsar Sink

Apache Pulsar supports Kafka Connect via its **Kafka Connect Adapter**, which allows running a Kafka Connect cluster that writes to Pulsar topics.

**Step 1:** Deploy Kafka Connect (standalone or distributed)

```bash
connect-distributed connect-distributed.properties
```

**Step 2:** Install the Pulsar Sink Connector JAR

Download from:
https://github.com/streamnative/pulsar-kafka-connect/releases

Place it in the Kafka Connect plugins path.

**Step 3:** Define your connector config

```json
{
"name": "jdbc-pulsar-sink",
"config": {
"connector.class": "org.apache.pulsar.io.kafka.connect.PulsarSinkConnector",
"topics": "source-topic",
"pulsar.service.url": "pulsar://localhost:6650",
"pulsar.topic": "persistent://public/default/db-stream",
"tasks.max": "1"
}
}
```

Submit it:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data @jdbc-pulsar-sink.json \
http://localhost:8083/connectors
```

#### Ingesting from Relational Databases (Debezium + Pulsar)

Use **Debezium Kafka Connector** to capture CDC (change data capture) events:

- Configure Debezium (MySQL/Postgres) as Kafka Connect source
- Set Pulsar as sink topic via Pulsar Sink Connector
- CDC events from your DB stream into Pulsar

```
[MySQL DB] → [Debezium Source] → [Kafka Connect] → [Pulsar Sink] → [Pulsar Topic]
```

This enables **real-time ingestion and replication** without writing custom integration code.

---

#### Ingesting from Cloud Services

With Kafka Connect’s cloud connectors, you can stream data from:

- **Amazon S3**
- **Google Pub/Sub**
- **Azure Blob Storage**
- **Salesforce, SAP, and more**

Using the same Pulsar sink connector setup, all ingested events land in **Pulsar topics** ready for stream processing.

#### Pulsar IO vs Kafka Connect

| Feature             | Pulsar IO                       | Kafka Connect Integration              |
|---------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Connector Library   | Smaller but growing             | 100+ mature connectors available       |
| Deployment          | Integrated in Pulsar cluster     | External Kafka Connect service         |
| Ecosystem           | Pulsar-native                   | Kafka-native (requires adaptation)     |
| Use Case Fit        | Pulsar-first architectures      | Hybrid / migration / interop scenarios |

Use Pulsar IO for Pulsar-native solutions. Use Kafka Connect when reusing existing Kafka pipelines or connectors is needed.

---

#### Monitoring and Observability

- Use **Pulsar Admin** to monitor sink topic throughput
- Monitor **Kafka Connect REST API** for connector status
- Add **Prometheus exporters** for Pulsar and Connect metrics
- Visualize with **Grafana** dashboards

Watch for:
- Lag in source connectors
- Pulsar topic write latency
- Connector failures or restarts

---

#### Best Practices

- Use **schema registry** (e.g., Confluent or Apicurio) for schema evolution
- Align **message formats** across systems (e.g., JSON, Avro)
- Use **topic naming conventions** to organize pipelines
- Deploy **Connectors as containers** for better portability
- Enable **dead-letter topics** to handle transformation or delivery failures

---

#### Conclusion

By integrating **Apache Pulsar with Kafka Connect**, you can rapidly build **end-to-end, real-time ingestion pipelines** that pull from virtually any data source into Pulsar's scalable messaging backbone. This combination offers the best of both worlds: the **extensive Kafka connector ecosystem** and the **cloud-native, multi-tenant architecture** of Pulsar.

Whether you’re modernizing legacy ingestion flows or building cloud-native data platforms, this approach accelerates development and streamlines operations.
