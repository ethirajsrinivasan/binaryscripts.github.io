As data pipelines scale to handle **billions of events per day**, infrastructure costs can become a significant concern. Apache Pulsar’s **cloud-native architecture** offers unique opportunities for **cost optimization** without compromising **throughput** or **reliability**.

In this blog, we’ll explore strategies for optimizing Apache Pulsar to support **low-cost, high-volume data pipelines**. From topic design and compaction to tiered storage and efficient consumer patterns — we’ll cover everything needed to run Pulsar at scale without breaking the budget.

#### Key Cost Drivers in Pulsar

To optimize costs, you first need to understand where Pulsar’s resource usage comes from:

- **Storage** (BookKeeper disks, tiered cloud storage)
- **Compute** (brokers and bookies)
- **Network** (data transfer between components)
- **Replication and redundancy overhead**
- **Message retention settings**

Tuning these areas effectively can help drive down cost per GB and cost per message.

#### 1. Use Tiered Storage to Offload Cold Data

Pulsar supports **tiered storage** with connectors for S3, GCS, Azure Blob, etc.

**Benefits:**
- Store hot data on fast (expensive) BookKeeper disks
- Offload cold segments to object storage (cheap and scalable)
- Reduce BookKeeper disk requirements

**Enable tiered offload:**

```bash
bin/pulsar-admin topics offload \
persistent://tenant/namespace/topic \
--size-threshold 10M
```

Configure in `broker.conf`:

```
managedLedgerOffloadDriver=s3
s3ManagedLedgerOffloadBucket=my-bucket
s3ManagedLedgerOffloadRegion=us-east-1
```

---

#### 2. Optimize Topic Partitions and Compaction

- Avoid excessive **partition counts** — each partition adds metadata overhead.
- Use **log compaction** to retain only the latest state per key instead of full history.

**Enable compaction:**

```bash
bin/pulsar-admin topics compact persistent://my-tenant/my-ns/my-topic
```

Use compaction for:
- User profiles
- Product catalogs
- IoT device states

---

#### 3. Tune Retention Policies

Unnecessary message retention = wasted storage = higher cost.

Set practical per-topic retention policies:

```bash
bin/pulsar-admin namespaces set-retention \
--size 1G \
--time 1h \
my-tenant/my-namespace
```

Best practices:
- Store long-term data in data lakes (S3, Hadoop)
- Keep Pulsar focused on recent, high-throughput data

---

#### 4. Use Batching and Compression

Reduce network and disk I/O by batching and compressing messages.

**Producer options:**

```java
Producer<byte[]> producer = client.newProducer()
.topic("high-volume")
.enableBatching(true)
.compressionType(CompressionType.LZ4)
.batchingMaxMessages(100)
.batchingMaxPublishDelay(10, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)
.create();
```

Compression types supported:
- LZ4 (best for speed)
- ZLIB / ZSTD (best for ratio)

---

#### 5. Reduce Replication Overhead (Where Safe)

- Default **replication factor** is 2 or 3 — safe but resource-heavy.
- For **non-critical** topics, reduce to 1 or 2 to save disk and bandwidth.

Example:

```
bookkeeperEnsemble=2
bookkeeperWriteQuorum=2
bookkeeperAckQuorum=1
```

Use caution: this reduces fault tolerance.

---

#### 6. Scale Using Shared Subscriptions

Avoid spinning up too many dedicated consumers. Use **Shared subscriptions** for:

- Load balancing
- Efficient resource usage
- Horizontal scaling

They also reduce consumer lag by increasing concurrency.

---

#### 7. Monitor and Right-Size Infrastructure

Use **Prometheus + Grafana** or Pulsar Manager to:

- Track disk usage per namespace
- Identify unused or underused topics
- Monitor backlog and consumer lag

Use metrics like:
- `pulsar_storage_used_storage_size`
- `pulsar_publish_rate`
- `pulsar_consumer_ack_rate`

Remove idle topics, scale down unused brokers/bookies, and automate cleanup.

---

#### 8. Use Function-as-a-Service for Processing

Instead of dedicated compute clusters, use **Pulsar Functions** or **AWS Lambda-style microservices**:

- Stateless processing
- No additional cluster to manage
- Event-driven billing in serverless environments

Pulsar Functions are ideal for simple filtering, routing, and transformation tasks.

---

#### 9. Consolidate Namespaces and Reduce Isolation Overhead

Overusing tenants/namespaces increases memory and metadata costs.

Best practices:
- Use per-application or per-team namespaces — not per-feature
- Consolidate under shared tenants with fine-grained permissions
- Reuse topics wherever logical (e.g., by event type)

---

#### Conclusion

Apache Pulsar offers a flexible, scalable foundation for **high-volume data pipelines**, but without the right tuning, costs can grow quickly. By leveraging features like **tiered storage**, **compaction**, **batching**, and **shared subscriptions**, you can reduce infrastructure usage while maintaining top-tier performance.

Start optimizing your Pulsar stack today to build **cost-effective, real-time systems** ready for production-scale workloads.
