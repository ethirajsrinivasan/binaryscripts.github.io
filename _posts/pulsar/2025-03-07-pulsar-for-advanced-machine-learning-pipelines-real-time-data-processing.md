Modern machine learning applications increasingly require **real-time data pipelines** that can perform **feature engineering**, **model inference**, and **continuous learning** on streaming data. Apache Pulsar, with its **scalable messaging**, **multi-topic support**, and **native serverless compute**, is uniquely positioned to serve as the backbone for advanced ML pipelines.

In this post, we’ll explore how to use **Apache Pulsar for real-time ML pipelines**, covering ingestion, transformation, model serving, and feedback loops — all within a streaming-first architecture.

#### Why Pulsar for Machine Learning Pipelines?

Apache Pulsar offers key features that make it ideal for ML:

- **High-throughput streaming** from real-time sources
- **Multi-tenant architecture** to isolate data domains
- **Native functions** for low-latency model inference
- **Built-in support** for schema validation and data versioning
- **Flexibility to plug in Flink, Spark, or custom ML runtimes**

It enables **streaming-first ML workflows** from data collection to model improvement.

#### Architecture Overview

```
[Devices / APIs / Kafka / Sensors]
↓
[Ingestion Topics (raw-events)]
↓
[Pulsar Functions / Flink / Spark]
↓
[Feature Topics (engineered-data)]
↓
[Model Inference Services / Pulsar Functions]
↓
[Prediction Topics]
↓
[Feedback Topics for Retraining]
```

Each stage is modular and scalable — allowing real-time ML without relying solely on batch ETL.

---

#### Step 1: Real-Time Ingestion

Use Pulsar producers or Kafka source connectors to push raw event data into Pulsar:

```bash
bin/pulsar-client produce persistent://ml/raw/sensor-input \
--messages '{"deviceId": "1234", "temp": 37.4, "ts": 1689912010}'
```

Use **AVRO or JSON schema** to ensure message consistency and evolution tracking.

---

#### Step 2: Feature Extraction with Pulsar Functions

Pulsar Functions enable lightweight compute directly on streams. Example: normalize temperature and add a feature flag.

```python
def normalize(event, context):
data = json.loads(event)
data['temp_scaled'] = (data['temp'] - 20) / 10
data['alert'] = data['temp_scaled'] > 1.5
return json.dumps(data)
```

Deploy with:

```bash
bin/pulsar-admin functions create \
--tenant ml --namespace features --name temp-transform \
--inputs persistent://ml/raw/sensor-input \
--output persistent://ml/features/sensor-transformed \
--py normalize.py \
--classname normalize
```

---

#### Step 3: Real-Time Model Inference

There are two options:

**A. Use Pulsar Functions** with embedded models (for fast, lightweight inference):

```python
from joblib import load
model = load("model.pkl")

def classify(event, context):
features = json.loads(event)
prediction = model.predict([[features['temp_scaled']]])
features['prediction'] = int(prediction[0])
return json.dumps(features)
```

**B. Route to external model servers** via REST using a sink connector or async consumer.

---

#### Step 4: Prediction and Feedback Loop

Send predictions to downstream systems or dashboards via:

- Sink connectors (e.g., Elasticsearch, PostgreSQL)
- REST API triggers
- ML monitoring tools (Seldon, Prometheus, etc.)

Capture outcomes (e.g., user feedback, actual results) into **feedback topics**:

```
persistent://ml/feedback/model-accuracy
```

Use these to continuously evaluate and retrain models.

---

#### Integration with Stream Processing Frameworks

Pulsar integrates natively with:

- **Apache Flink**: Streaming joins, aggregations, windowed processing
- **Apache Spark Structured Streaming**: Real-time transformations and MLlib scoring
- **Airflow / MLFlow**: For orchestration and tracking

Use Flink to join event streams with reference data (user profiles, geo-tags, etc.) before inference.

---

#### Performance and Scaling Considerations

- Use **Key_Shared subscriptions** to maintain order while parallelizing per user/device
- Enable **batching** on producers and consumers for higher throughput
- Store intermediate features in **RocksDB-backed** stateful functions
- Monitor function execution time with Pulsar’s built-in metrics
- Scale functions horizontally across partitions and tenants

---

#### Real-World Use Cases

- **Fraud Detection**: Score transactions in <100ms using streaming features
- **Personalized Ads**: Update user vectors and deliver real-time content
- **Predictive Maintenance**: Ingest sensor readings and trigger alerts
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Feed real-time demand data into pricing algorithms

---

#### Conclusion

Apache Pulsar provides a highly adaptable platform for **real-time machine learning pipelines**, combining messaging, transformation, inference, and feedback within a single architecture. With **serverless Pulsar Functions**, **scalable topic patterns**, and **integration with leading ML ecosystems**, Pulsar helps bring machine learning models from batch to real-time — enabling smarter decisions at scale.

If you're building the next generation of intelligent applications, **Pulsar should be a core part of your ML infrastructure**.
