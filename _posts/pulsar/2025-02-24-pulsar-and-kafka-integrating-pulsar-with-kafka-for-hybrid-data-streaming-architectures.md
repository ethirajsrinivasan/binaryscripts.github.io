Apache Pulsar and Apache Kafka are two of the most popular distributed messaging platforms, each with unique architectural strengths. While Kafka dominates traditional streaming ecosystems, Pulsar offers a modern cloud-native alternative with features like **multi-tenancy**, **native geo-replication**, and **tiered storage**.

In some cases, enterprises may need to **integrate Kafka and Pulsar** — for reasons like **gradual migration**, **multi-platform interoperability**, or **connecting isolated domains**. This post explores how to build **hybrid Kafka-Pulsar architectures**, covering bridging tools, design patterns, and real-world integration examples.

---

#### Why Integrate Kafka and Pulsar?

Here are common scenarios that demand Kafka-Pulsar integration:

- ✅ **Legacy modernization**: Gradually migrate from Kafka to Pulsar
- ✅ **Domain isolation**: Use Pulsar for multi-tenant workloads while Kafka handles legacy pipelines
- ✅ **Cross-team collaboration**: Bridge Kafka events into Pulsar for independent processing
- ✅ **Resilience and flexibility**: Build vendor-agnostic systems with better failover and routing

---

#### Architectural Overview

A typical hybrid setup looks like:

```
[Producers] → [Kafka Topic] → [Kafka Source Connector] → [Pulsar Topic] → [Consumers]

[Pulsar Producers] → [Pulsar Topic] → [Kafka Sink Connector] → [Kafka Topic] → [Consumers]
```

Kafka and Pulsar can be **bi-directionally connected** using **bridge connectors**, allowing seamless message flow between ecosystems.

---

#### Integration Tools

##### 1. **Pulsar Kafka Compatibility Wrapper**

Pulsar includes a **Kafka-on-Pulsar (KoP)** protocol handler:
- Allows Kafka clients to **connect directly to Pulsar** brokers
- No code changes required on the Kafka producer/consumer side
- Useful for **drop-in migration** or co-existence

Enable KoP in Pulsar configuration:

```properties
messagingProtocols=kafka
protocolHandlerDirectory=./protocols
```

Then use standard Kafka libraries to connect to Pulsar as if it's Kafka.

---

##### 2. **Kafka Connect → Pulsar Sink**

Bridge Kafka topics into Pulsar using a **Kafka Connect sink**:

- Use [Pulsar Kafka Connect Sink Connector](https://pulsar.apache.org/docs/next/io-kafka-connect/)
- Works with existing Kafka Connect deployments

```json
{
"name": "kafka-to-pulsar",
"config": {
"connector.class": "org.apache.pulsar.io.kafka.connect.KafkaConnectSink",
"topics": "orders",
"pulsar.service.url": "pulsar://broker:6650",
"pulsar.topic": "persistent://public/default/orders",
"tasks.max": "1"
}
}
```

---

##### 3. **Pulsar IO Kafka Source**

Use **Pulsar IO connectors** to read from Kafka into Pulsar natively:

```bash
pulsar-admin sources create \
--source-type kafka \
--source-config-file kafka-source-config.yaml \
--tenant public \
--namespace default \
--name kafka-source
```

Sample `kafka-source-config.yaml`:

```yaml
bootstrapServers: "kafka-broker:9092"
topics: "events"
groupId: "pulsar-bridge"
```

---

#### Real-World Use Case Examples

##### ✅ Use Case 1: Kafka Ingestion → Pulsar Processing

- Legacy systems push data to Kafka
- Data is ingested into Pulsar via Pulsar IO Kafka Source
- Pulsar Streams or Functions handle real-time transformations

##### ✅ Use Case 2: Pulsar Stream to Kafka Analytics

- IoT devices produce events to Pulsar
- Events forwarded to Kafka via Kafka Sink for further warehousing
- Downstream tools like Kafka Connect, Flink consume from Kafka

##### ✅ Use Case 3: Gradual Migration from Kafka to Pulsar

- Enable KoP in Pulsar
- Redirect Kafka clients to Pulsar without rewriting app logic
- Decommission legacy brokers progressively

---

#### Schema Compatibility & Interoperability

- Use **Confluent Schema Registry** with Kafka
- Use **Pulsar's built-in schema registry** or connect to Confluent
- For cross-platform schemas, serialize with **Avro** or **Protobuf**
- Ensure **consistent field evolution** strategies on both ends

---

#### Monitoring and Observability

Track hybrid pipelines with:
- **Kafka Exporter** for Prometheus metrics
- **Pulsar Exporter** or Grafana dashboards
- Log events between bridge connectors for latency and error tracking

Watch for:
- Connector lag
- Replication failures
- Throughput drops across bridged clusters

---

#### Security Considerations

- Use **TLS and mTLS** for inter-cluster communication
- Secure both Kafka and Pulsar with **ACLs** and **authentication providers**
- Avoid topic name collisions when bridging (use namespaces wisely)
- Audit all access points using broker logs and access control events

---

#### Best Practices

✅ Start with **uni-directional bridges** before going bi-directional  
✅ Apply **message deduplication** where exactly-once is critical  
✅ Use **schema validation** at both source and sink  
✅ Monitor **connector health and lag** constantly  
✅ Keep **topic naming consistent** across systems  
✅ Prefer **KoP for greenfield Pulsar migrations**  
✅ Run **load tests** on hybrid connectors before production

---

#### Conclusion

Bridging **Apache Pulsar** and **Apache Kafka** empowers organizations to combine the best of both messaging platforms — scalability, flexibility, and ecosystem maturity. Whether you're modernizing legacy systems or building a polyglot event mesh, Pulsar-Kafka hybrid architectures provide the **resilience and extensibility** to power real-time, enterprise-grade data pipelines.

By using the right connectors, tuning schema strategies, and following integration best practices, you can create a **unified streaming fabric** across platforms.
