excerpt: Learn how to use Apache Pulsar Functions to create lightweight, serverless stream processing applications for real-time data transformation and analytics.

Apache Pulsar is not just a powerful messaging system—it also comes with **native stream processing capabilities** via **Pulsar Functions**. These lightweight, serverless functions allow developers to **write and deploy real-time transformations**, enrichments, and analytics directly within the Pulsar ecosystem—without needing external processing engines like Flink or Spark.

In this post, we’ll explore how to **create stream processing applications using Pulsar Functions**, understand their architecture, and walk through real-world use cases and best practices.

#### What Are Pulsar Functions?

**Pulsar Functions** are small, event-driven pieces of code that consume messages from Pulsar topics, process them, and publish the results to another topic.

Key benefits:
- **Serverless**: No need to manage streaming engines
- **Language support**: Write functions in Java, Python, or Go
- **Low latency**: Ideal for lightweight, fast processing
- **Easy deployment**: Use CLI or YAML for function management

Functions can also:
- Write to external systems (via sink connectors)
- Trigger alerts
- Maintain lightweight state via state stores

#### Hello World: Pulsar Function Example in Python

Create a simple function that filters sensor data:

**sensor_filter.py**

```python
def process(input, context):
data = json.loads(input)
if data["temperature"] > 75:
return json.dumps(data)
else:
return None
```

Deploy it using the Pulsar CLI:

```bash
bin/pulsar-admin functions create \
--name high-temp-filter \
--inputs sensor-data \
--output high-temp-alerts \
--py sensor_filter.py \
--classname sensor_filter.process
```

---

#### Stateful Functions

Pulsar Functions support state management via:

- **Key/value state stores**
- APIs for **incremental counters**, **lookup**, and **update**

Example (Java):

```java
context.putState("count", currentCount + 1);
long total = context.getState("count");
```

Useful for:
- Aggregation
- Rate limiting
- Stateful enrichments

---

#### Use Cases

1. **IoT Analytics**
  - Filter and route sensor data in real-time
  - Enrich messages with device metadata

2. **Fraud Detection**
  - Trigger alerts on suspicious transaction patterns
  - Combine multiple input streams for correlation

3. **Log Transformation**
  - Normalize and enrich application logs
  - Forward to downstream analytics systems

4. **ML Inference at Edge**
  - Call model APIs or lightweight classifiers on incoming messages

---

#### Deploying at Scale

Use **Kubernetes** with the Pulsar Operator or Helm charts to deploy Functions in production:

- Enable **Function Workers** in standalone or cluster mode
- Scale function instances with the `--parallelism` flag
- Monitor using **Prometheus**, **Grafana**, or **Pulsar Manager UI**

---

#### Best Practices

- Keep function logic **lightweight** — offload heavy compute elsewhere
- Use **parallelism** for throughput scaling
- Handle **serialization errors** gracefully
- Isolate state per key to avoid race conditions
- Log important metrics and exceptions

---

#### Conclusion

Apache Pulsar Functions make it easy to build and deploy **streaming logic inside your messaging layer**, enabling **fast, serverless, and distributed processing** for real-time data. Whether you're building IoT filters, real-time fraud detection, or data enrichment pipelines, Pulsar Functions provide a simple and scalable way to move beyond just messaging — and into processing.

Start building your **stream-native apps** today with just a few lines of code and the power of Apache Pulsar.
