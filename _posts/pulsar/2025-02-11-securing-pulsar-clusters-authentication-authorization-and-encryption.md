Security is a critical concern for any modern messaging platform, especially when dealing with sensitive data or multi-tenant environments. **Apache Pulsar** provides a comprehensive security framework that includes **authentication**, **authorization**, and **encryption**, ensuring secure communication and controlled access across producers, consumers, and administrators.

This guide covers the core concepts and configuration steps needed to **secure a Pulsar cluster**, highlighting best practices for production deployments.

#### Pulsar Security Overview

Apache Pulsar's security architecture includes:

- **Authentication**: Verifies the identity of clients and users
- **Authorization**: Grants or denies access to resources based on roles
- **Encryption**: Protects data in transit (TLS) and at rest (optional)

These features are modular and can be configured based on your organization’s needs.

---

#### 1. Authentication in Pulsar

Authentication ensures that only verified users and services can connect to the cluster.

Supported mechanisms:
- **TLS Authentication**
- **JWT Tokens**
- **OAuth 2.0**
- **Kerberos (via SASL)**

##### TLS Authentication Example

Generate certificates for broker and client, then configure:

**Broker Configuration (broker.conf):**

```
authenticationEnabled=true
authenticationProviders=org.apache.pulsar.broker.authentication.AuthenticationProviderTls
tlsEnabled=true
tlsCertificateFilePath=/path/to/broker-cert.pem
tlsKeyFilePath=/path/to/broker-key.pem
```

**Client Configuration:**

```bash
bin/pulsar-client consume persistent://my-tenant/my-ns/my-topic \
--auth-plugin org.apache.pulsar.client.impl.auth.AuthenticationTls \
--auth-params "tlsCertFile:/path/client-cert.pem,tlsKeyFile:/path/client-key.pem"
```

##### JWT Token Authentication

Generate token using Pulsar’s tool:

```bash
bin/pulsar tokens create --secret-key file:///path/to/secret.key
```

Set auth plugin and secret key in both broker and client.

---

#### 2. Authorization and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

After authentication, **authorization** determines what a client is allowed to do.

Enable in `broker.conf`:

```
authorizationEnabled=true
authorizationProvider=org.apache.pulsar.broker.authorization.PulsarAuthorizationProvider
```

Use the Pulsar admin CLI to grant permissions:

```bash
bin/pulsar-admin namespaces grant-permission \
--actions produce,consume \
--role my-app-role \
my-tenant/my-namespace
```

You can also restrict topic-level access and define policies for **produce**, **consume**, **functions**, and **administration**.

---

#### 3. Transport Layer Security (TLS)

Use **TLS encryption** to secure data in transit between:

- Brokers ↔ Clients
- Brokers ↔ Bookies
- Brokers ↔ Other Brokers

**Enable TLS on broker side:**

```
tlsEnabled=true
tlsCertificateFilePath=/etc/pulsar/certs/broker.pem
tlsKeyFilePath=/etc/pulsar/certs/broker.key
tlsTrustCertsFilePath=/etc/pulsar/certs/ca.pem
```

**Client config example:**

```java
ClientBuilder client = PulsarClient.builder()
.serviceUrl("pulsar+ssl://broker:6651")
.enableTls(true)
.tlsTrustCertsFilePath("/etc/pulsar/certs/ca.pem")
.build();
```

---

#### 4. Securing BookKeeper (Storage Layer)

Apache Pulsar uses **Apache BookKeeper** to persist messages. Secure communication with bookies by:

- Enabling TLS between brokers and bookies
- Using **Zookeeper ACLs** to restrict access

**bookkeeper.conf:**

```
tlsProvider=OpenSSL
tlsCertificatePath=/path/to/bookie-cert.pem
tlsKeyPath=/path/to/bookie-key.pem
tlsTrustCertsPath=/path/to/ca.pem
```

Enable BookKeeper authentication:

```
authentication.enabled=true
authentication.provider.class=org.apache.bookkeeper.auth.SASLAuthenticationProvider
```

---

#### 5. Multi-Tenant Security

Pulsar supports **multi-tenancy** out of the box. Secure tenants using:

- **Separate roles per tenant**
- **Resource quotas** (e.g., topic limits, message rate)
- **Namespace isolation policies**

This ensures that one tenant cannot interfere with or access another’s data.

---

#### 6. Best Practices for Securing Pulsar

- Always use **TLS encryption** for internal and external communication
- Enable **authentication and authorization** in all environments (not just production)
- Rotate **tokens and certificates** periodically
- Apply **least privilege** by assigning only required permissions to roles
- Monitor access and audit logs for unusual behavior
- Integrate with **external identity providers** using OAuth2 or LDAP
- Use **Secrets Manager** (AWS/GCP/Azure) to manage private keys securely

---

#### Conclusion

Securing Apache Pulsar is essential for protecting your data streams and ensuring compliance with modern security standards. By enabling **authentication, enforcing fine-grained authorization, and encrypting communications**, you can deploy Pulsar with confidence in both internal and internet-facing architectures.

Whether you're running a multi-tenant cloud platform or an internal event bus, these security best practices help keep your **messaging infrastructure safe, reliable, and compliant**.
