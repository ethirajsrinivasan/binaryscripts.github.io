As businesses grow across regions and platforms, adopting a **multi-cloud strategy** ensures **resilience**, **vendor flexibility**, and **low-latency global access**. Apache Pulsar, with its **multi-layer distributed architecture**, is well-suited for multi-cloud deployments that require **scalable and reliable event streaming**.

In this post, we explore how to **deploy Apache Pulsar in a multi-cloud environment**, addressing challenges such as **data replication**, **geo-partitioning**, **service discovery**, and **network latency** to achieve high scalability and availability.

#### Why Deploy Pulsar in Multi-Cloud?

Multi-cloud deployments allow organizations to:
- **Avoid vendor lock-in**
- Ensure **business continuity** during regional cloud outages
- Achieve **low-latency processing** close to end users
- Satisfy **regulatory compliance** by storing data regionally

Apache Pulsar supports multi-cloud readiness with:
- Built-in **geo-replication**
- **Decoupled storage and compute**
- Multi-tenant isolation
- Dynamic **topic-level data routing**

---

#### Pulsar Architecture Overview

Apache Pulsar's modular components enable flexible multi-cloud placement:

- **Brokers**: Stateless message routers (can run on any cloud)
- **Bookies (BookKeeper nodes)**: Store messages durably
- **ZooKeeper**: Stores metadata and cluster coordination
- **Proxy**: Load balancing and secure ingress for cross-cloud clients

```
Cloud A          Cloud B          Cloud C
+--------+       +--------+       +--------+
| Broker |  ⇄⇄   | Broker |  ⇄⇄   | Broker |
+--------+       +--------+       +--------+
⇣                ⇣                ⇣
[Bookie]         [Bookie]         [Bookie]
⇣                ⇣                ⇣
[ZK + Proxy]     [ZK + Proxy]     [ZK + Proxy]
```

#### Deployment Topologies

##### 1. **Stretched Cluster**

- Single Pulsar cluster spanning multiple clouds/regions
- Shared ZooKeeper quorum and metadata
- Requires low-latency (<100ms) network links

Pros:
- Simplified configuration
- Global topic availability

Cons:
- Requires strong inter-cloud networking
- Not ideal for high-latency WANs

---

##### 2. **Multiple Isolated Clusters with Geo-Replication**

- Separate Pulsar clusters per cloud/region
- Use **geo-replication** to sync messages across clusters

```
[Cluster A] ←→ [Cluster B] ←→ [Cluster C]
Geo-Replicated Topics: customer-events, audit-logs
```

Pros:
- Loose coupling
- High fault isolation
- Easy to enforce data locality

Cons:
- Added complexity in topic syncing and duplication avoidance

---

#### Networking and Connectivity

To ensure secure and performant cross-cloud communication:

- Use **TLS encryption** and **mTLS** between Pulsar components
- Establish **VPN tunnels** or **private link endpoints** across cloud providers
- Use **DNS-based service discovery** for cluster failover and routing
- Prefer **regional brokers** for latency-sensitive consumers

Example:
- Use AWS Transit Gateway or GCP VPC Peering with firewall rules for internal Pulsar traffic

---

#### Geo-Replication in Pulsar

Enable replication for a namespace:

```bash
pulsar-admin namespaces set-replication-clusters \
--clusters cloud-a,cloud-b \
my-tenant/my-namespace
```

Pulsar will automatically:
- Replicate messages between clusters
- Maintain **per-cluster cursors**
- Ensure ordering and deduplication per subscription

Use replication to:
- Route events from cloud-based producers to consumers in another region
- Build DR-ready architectures with minimal latency

---

#### Storage Tiering and Scalability

- Pulsar supports **tiered storage** (e.g., AWS S3, GCS, Azure Blob)
- Offloads old data from BookKeeper to object storage
- Enables **cost-efficient long-term retention**

Configure via:

```bash
pulsar-admin namespaces set-offload-threshold "5G" \
my-tenant/my-namespace
```

Benefits:
- Scales capacity independently from performance
- Keeps Bookies light for recent, hot data

---

#### Deployment Strategies

1. **Helm + Kubernetes**:
  - Use **pulsar-helm-chart** for multi-cloud K8s clusters (EKS, GKE, AKS)
  - Use **Node Affinity** and **Topology Spread Constraints** for fault zones

2. **Terraform**:
  - Automate Pulsar deployment across clouds
  - Manage infrastructure, IAM roles, peering, etc.

3. **Hybrid**:
  - Run Pulsar brokers on cloud VMs
  - Use managed Kubernetes for Bookies and ZooKeeper

---

#### Monitoring and Observability

- Enable **Prometheus + Grafana** dashboards per cloud region
- Use **Alertmanager** for health checks (broker up/down, topic lag)
- Monitor:
  - **Replication backlog**
  - **Disk I/O on Bookies**
  - **Subscription redelivery rates**
  - **End-to-end latency**

---

#### Best Practices

- Use **dedicated clusters per region** for clean failover
- Enable **namespace-level policies** for rate limits and replication
- Keep **ZK quorum odd-sized** and geographically aware
- Automate **failover and scaling** using Kubernetes and Pulsar Manager
- Compress messages with LZ4/Zstd to reduce cross-cloud egress cost

---

#### Conclusion

Deploying Apache Pulsar in a **multi-cloud environment** enables globally distributed applications to achieve **high scalability**, **fault tolerance**, and **compliance with data residency** requirements. With built-in geo-replication, storage offloading, and flexible deployment patterns, Pulsar is an excellent choice for **next-gen real-time infrastructure** across cloud boundaries.

By following the architectural strategies and best practices outlined above, your organization can confidently deliver **resilient, high-throughput event streaming** across AWS, Azure, GCP, and beyond.
