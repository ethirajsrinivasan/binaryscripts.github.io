As data volumes and velocity surge across modern enterprises, traditional batch ETL pipelines struggle to meet the demands of real-time analytics and operational agility. Enter **Apache Pulsar** — a cloud-native messaging and event-streaming platform that enables **continuous data integration** into **data lakes** and **lakehouse architectures**.

This post explores how Pulsar helps build **scalable, real-time data ingestion pipelines**, decouples sources from sinks, supports schema evolution, and delivers **streaming ETL** to transform raw data into analytics-ready formats.

#### Why Use Apache Pulsar for Data Lake Integration?

Apache Pulsar offers key advantages for continuous data integration:

- **Decoupled compute and storage** for flexible scaling
- **Multi-tenancy and isolation** across pipelines
- **Built-in schema registry** for data consistency
- Support for **streaming ETL** using Pulsar Functions and IO connectors
- Seamless **integration with object stores, warehouses, and analytics tools**

By acting as a central message bus, Pulsar allows multiple producers and consumers to work independently — reducing operational coupling between systems.

#### Data Lake Ingestion Architecture with Pulsar

```

[Pulsar Topics]
↓
[Stream Processing / Pulsar Functions]
↓
[Data Lake (e.g., S3 / ADLS / HDFS)]
↓
[Query Engines: Presto / Trino / Athena]
```

This architecture allows for real-time data flow into your lake, enabling near-instant analytics and continuous model updates.

#### Ingesting Data from Source Systems

Use **Pulsar IO connectors** or custom producers to bring data into Pulsar from:

- **Relational databases** (via CDC tools like Debezium)
- **NoSQL stores**
- **RESTful APIs**
- **Log streams (Syslog, FluentBit)**
- **IoT devices and sensors**

Example: Connect MySQL CDC into Pulsar

```json
{
"tenant": "data",
"namespace": "integration",
"name": "mysql-cdc-source",
"archive": "connectors/pulsar-io-debezium-mysql.nar",
"topicName": "mysql-orders",
"configs": {
"database.hostname": "mysql.internal",
"database.port": "3306",
"database.user": "replicator",
"database.password": "password",
"database.server.name": "orders",
"database.whitelist": "ecommerce"
}
}
```

---

#### Stream Processing and Transformation

Transform and enrich incoming data before it hits the data lake using:

- **Pulsar Functions**
- **Apache Flink**
- **Apache Spark Structured Streaming**

Example: Pulsar Function to filter and enrich events

```python
def process(input, context):
event = json.loads(input)
if event["status"] == "completed":
event["processed_at"] = context.get_current_message_topic_name()
return json.dumps(event)
```

---

#### Storing in Data Lake Destinations

Write transformed data to:

- **Amazon S3 / Azure Data Lake / HDFS**
- **Delta Lake or Apache Iceberg**
- **Parquet / Avro / ORC** file formats

Use Pulsar’s **Sinks** or integrate via **Apache NiFi**, **Kafka Connect (via MirrorMaker)**, or **custom Flink/Spark jobs**.

Example: Configure Pulsar IO sink to S3

```json
{
"archive": "connectors/pulsar-io-s3.nar",
"topicName": "processed-orders",
"name": "s3-sink",
"tenant": "data",
"namespace": "integration",
"configs": {
"bucketName": "my-data-lake",
"region": "us-east-1",
"accessKeyId": "xxx",
"secretAccessKey": "yyy",
"formatType": "parquet",
"batchSize": "500"
}
}
```

#### Schema Management and Evolution

Apache Pulsar supports **schema enforcement at the topic level** using Avro, JSON, Protobuf.

- Producers register schema automatically
- Consumers can enforce compatibility (BACKWARD, FORWARD, FULL)

Benefits:
- Prevents schema drift
- Ensures downstream systems receive consistent data
- Enables **schema evolution without downtime**

---

#### Real-Time Use Cases

- **E-Commerce**: Sync order, cart, and user data into a real-time lake for personalization
- **IoT**: Stream device metrics and anomalies into the lake for monitoring and ML
- **Finance**: Ingest transaction logs for fraud detection and compliance
- **Healthcare**: Collect patient vitals and EHR updates for live dashboards

---

#### Best Practices

- Partition topics based on volume (e.g., by region or customer ID)
- Use **batching and compression** for high-volume streams
- Implement **backpressure and retry handling** in Pulsar Functions
- Use **Schema Registry** for versioning and enforcement
- Monitor ingestion with **Prometheus / Grafana / Pulsar Manager**

---

#### Conclusion

Apache Pulsar makes it easy to build **real-time, scalable, and flexible data integration pipelines** for data lakes. With built-in support for **schema management**, **streaming transformation**, and **multi-sink delivery**, Pulsar is a powerful engine for modern **lakehouse architectures**.

By adopting Pulsar, you can break free from batch ETL, reduce pipeline complexity
