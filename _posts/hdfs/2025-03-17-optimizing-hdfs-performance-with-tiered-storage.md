As data volumes explode, not all data in a Hadoop ecosystem requires the same level of storage performance. While some data is accessed frequently and needs low-latency response ("hot" data), other datasets are rarely accessed and can reside on slower, cheaper storage ("cold" data).

To address this, **HDFS supports tiered storage**, allowing administrators to classify data based on access frequency and **store it across different storage media** like SSDs, HDDs, and archival volumes — optimizing both **performance and cost**.

In this blog, we’ll explore how to use **tiered storage in HDFS**, configure storage types, apply data placement policies, and implement best practices for performance tuning and lifecycle management.

#### What is Tiered Storage in HDFS?

**Tiered storage** is the ability to use different types of storage hardware in the same HDFS cluster, categorized into:

- **Hot (SSD)**: High-speed, low-latency storage for frequently accessed data
- **Warm (HDD)**: Standard magnetic disks for regular data
- **Cold (ARCHIVE/REMOTE)**: Slow or remote storage for rarely accessed data

HDFS lets you assign **storage types** to DataNode volumes and apply **block placement policies** to control where data lives.

#### Configuring Storage Types in HDFS

1. **Define storage types per DataNode** in `hdfs-site.xml`:

```xml
<property>
<name>dfs.datanode.data.dir</name>
<value>[SSD]/data/ssd,[DISK]/data/disk,[ARCHIVE]/data/archive</value>
</property>
```

Example:

```xml
<value>[SSD]/mnt/ssd1,[DISK]/mnt/hdd1,[ARCHIVE]/mnt/archive1</value>
```

This registers multiple volumes with different performance characteristics.

2. **Enable storage policy support** (Hadoop 2.6+):

```bash
hdfs storagepolicies -listPolicies
```

Available policies:
- `HOT`: All replicas on DISK
- `WARM`: One on SSD, rest on DISK
- `COLD`: All on ARCHIVE
- `ALL_SSD`: All replicas on SSD
- `ONE_SSD`: One replica on SSD
- `LAZY_PERSIST`: Uses RAM disk (for temporary data)

---

#### Assigning Storage Policies to Directories

Use `hdfs storagepolicies` to assign storage types to directories:

```bash
hdfs storagepolicies -setStoragePolicy -path /user/analytics/hot -policy HOT
hdfs storagepolicies -setStoragePolicy -path /user/analytics/cold -policy COLD
```

To verify:

```bash
hdfs storagepolicies -getStoragePolicy -path /user/analytics/hot
```

Files written to these directories will follow the associated placement policy.

---

#### Data Lifecycle Management with Tiered Storage

1. **Ingest into HOT tier**:
   New, high-value data (e.g., streaming logs, transactions) are written to SSD-backed storage.

2. **Migrate to WARM/COLD tiers**:
   Use lifecycle scripts or automated jobs to move older data:

```bash
hdfs mover -p /user/analytics/2023/ -bandwidth 50
```

The `hdfs mover` tool rebalances blocks based on the directory's storage policy.

3. **Purge or archive cold data**:
   Data no longer needed can be moved to S3, Glacier, or deleted.

---

#### Performance Benefits of Tiered Storage

- **Faster analytics**: SSDs reduce query latency for time-sensitive data
- **Lower IOPS pressure**: Separates heavy workloads from cold storage reads
- **Cost-effective scaling**: Use HDDs and archive disks for long-term storage
- **Better hardware utilization**: Match data with the right storage profile

---

#### Monitoring and Tuning Tiered Storage

1. **Monitor block distribution**:

```bash
hdfs fsck /user/analytics/ -files -blocks -locations
```

2. **Check storage usage**:

```bash
hdfs dfsadmin -report
```

3. **Track mover performance**:

Use logs and cluster metrics (via Ambari, Cloudera Manager, Prometheus) to ensure rebalancing and policies are applied as expected.

---

#### Best Practices

- Use **SSD** storage for:
  - Recent logs
  - Real-time dashboards
  - Hive/Presto query targets

- Use **DISK/HDD** for:
  - ETL staging data
  - Machine learning feature stores
  - Mid-frequency access files

- Use **ARCHIVE** for:
  - Historical snapshots
  - Compliance storage
  - Monthly or yearly reports

- Schedule the **HDFS mover** to rebalance blocks during low-usage hours

- Align storage tiers with **business SLAs** for performance and retention

#### Conclusion

Tiered storage in HDFS provides a strategic way to optimize performance, control costs, and streamline data access across different temperature layers. By combining high-speed SSDs, reliable HDDs, and inexpensive archive storage — all within a single Hadoop cluster — you can design a scalable, efficient, and future-ready data architecture.

Start implementing tiered storage today to ensure your big data platform is **optimized, responsive, and sustainable** for the long haul.
