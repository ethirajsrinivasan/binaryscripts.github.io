excerpt: Learn how to troubleshoot and resolve common HDFS failures in production environments. Covers DataNode crashes, NameNode issues, disk errors, block reports, and recovery strategies for high availability clusters.

Despite HDFS being a robust and resilient distributed file system, failures are inevitable in any production environment. Whether it's a **DataNode crash**, **block corruption**, or **NameNode overload**, these issues can impact data availability and job execution.

This guide provides a hands-on approach to **debugging and resolving common HDFS failures**, helping data engineers and administrators maintain cluster health and quickly respond to outages or anomalies.

#### 1. NameNode Not Starting

**Symptoms:**
- `namenode` daemon fails to start
- Errors like “`Incompatible clusterIDs`” or “`FsImage not found`”

**Troubleshooting Steps:**
- Check logs at: `/var/log/hadoop/hdfs/hadoop-hdfs-namenode-<hostname>.log`
- Ensure proper permissions on `dfs.namenode.name.dir`
- Validate clusterID consistency across all nodes

**Resolution:**
- Run `hdfs namenode -format` only if it’s a new cluster
- Use `hdfs namenode -bootstrapStandby` for HA standby initialization
- Restore from FsImage/Edits backup if corruption occurred

---

#### 2. DataNode Failure or Unresponsive

**Symptoms:**
- DataNode goes into “Dead” state in UI
- Replication alerts appear
- Disk read/write errors in logs

**Troubleshooting Steps:**
- Examine DataNode logs:
  ```
  /var/log/hadoop/hdfs/hadoop-hdfs-datanode-<hostname>.log
  ```
- Check disk space and inode exhaustion:
  ```
  df -h / hdfs dfsadmin -report
  ```

**Resolution:**
- Restart DataNode with:
  ```
  systemctl restart hadoop-hdfs-datanode
  ```
- Decommission if permanently down
- Replace faulty disk and rebalance using:
  ```
  hdfs balancer
  ```

---

#### 3. Under-Replicated or Missing Blocks

**Symptoms:**
- Warnings for under-replicated blocks
- Jobs fail due to missing block data

**Troubleshooting Steps:**
- Run:
  ```
  hdfs fsck / -files -blocks -locations
  ```
- Identify block IDs and affected files

**Resolution:**
- Use replication tools:
  ```
  hdfs dfs -setrep -w 3 /user/hive/warehouse/sales
  ```
- Increase replication factor temporarily
- Ensure enough DataNodes are available and healthy

---

#### 4. Disk Full on DataNode

**Symptoms:**
- Writes fail with “No space left on device”
- DataNode marked as dead or unresponsive

**Troubleshooting Steps:**
- Check storage report:
  ```
  hdfs dfsadmin -report
  ```
- Inspect disk usage:
  ```
  du -sh /data/hdfs/datanode/*
  ```

**Resolution:**
- Add new disks or directories to `dfs.datanode.data.dir`
- Remove unnecessary temp files
- Use `hdfs balancer` to distribute blocks

---

#### 5. FsImage or Edits Corruption

**Symptoms:**
- NameNode won’t start or crashes on boot
- Logs show “Unable to load FSImage” or “Edits log corrupt”

**Troubleshooting Steps:**
- Try starting NameNode in recovery mode:
  ```
  hdfs namenode -recover
  ```
- Inspect image files in `/dfs/nn/current/`

**Resolution:**
- Roll back to previous checkpoint
- Delete corrupt edits logs if necessary
- Always back up `fsimage` and `edits` regularly

---

#### 6. RPC or Network Failures

**Symptoms:**
- Clients can't read/write
- UI shows “Connection refused” or timeout errors

**Troubleshooting Steps:**
- Verify ports:
  ```
  netstat -tulnp | grep 8020
  ```
- Test NameNode RPC availability:
  ```
  hdfs dfs -ls /
  ```

**Resolution:**
- Check firewall and SELinux rules
- Restart affected services
- Review `/etc/hosts` or DNS resolution

---

#### 7. Slow HDFS Reads or Writes

**Symptoms:**
- Job delays in reading from HDFS
- High CPU or disk IO on DataNodes

**Troubleshooting Steps:**
- Use tools like `iotop`, `nmon`, or `iostat`
- Check short-circuit read config:
  ```
  dfs.client.read.shortcircuit = true
  ```

**Resolution:**
- Enable short-circuit local reads
- Tune file buffer sizes and replication
- Consolidate small files

---

#### 8. HDFS Balancer Not Working

**Symptoms:**
- Balancer reports success, but data skew persists
- “No block can be moved” in logs

**Troubleshooting Steps:**
- Run:
  ```
  hdfs balancer -threshold 10
  ```
- Verify block movement rules and rack awareness

**Resolution:**
- Increase balancer bandwidth:
  ```
  dfs.datanode.balance.bandwidthPerSec
  ```
- Temporarily disable rack awareness (not recommended long-term)

---

#### Best Practices for HDFS Troubleshooting

- Always check log files in `/var/log/hadoop/hdfs/`
- Use `hdfs fsck` regularly for file system integrity checks
- Monitor cluster health via **Cloudera Manager**, **Ambari**, or **Prometheus**
- Automate alerting for disk space, dead nodes, and under-replicated blocks
- Maintain regular snapshots and backups of `fsimage` and `edits`

---

#### Conclusion

While HDFS is designed for fault tolerance, **proactive monitoring** and **systematic troubleshooting** are key to avoiding data loss and performance issues. By understanding common failure patterns — and how to resolve them — you can ensure your Hadoop-based data platform remains robust, available, and production-ready.
