excerpt: Learn how to configure and manage HDFS metadata with Namenode High Availability (HA). Explore Active-Standby architecture, shared storage, ZooKeeper failover, and metadata synchronization for enterprise resilience.

In Hadoop, the **Namenode** is the single source of truth for HDFS metadata — including file system structure, file-to-block mappings, and permissions. If the Namenode fails, the entire file system becomes inaccessible, even though the actual data blocks remain intact on the DataNodes.

To overcome this **single point of failure**, HDFS supports **Namenode High Availability (HA)** — allowing multiple Namenodes to ensure uninterrupted access to metadata in production environments.

In this blog, we'll explore how **metadata is managed in HDFS**, how **Namenode HA works**, and how to implement a resilient architecture with **automatic failover** and **shared metadata consistency**.

---

#### Importance of Metadata in HDFS

The Namenode manages:
- File system hierarchy
- Block locations and replication info
- File permissions and ownership
- File sizes, timestamps, and quotas

All metadata is held **in-memory** on the Namenode and persisted to:
- **FsImage**: The checkpointed metadata snapshot
- **EditLog**: A write-ahead log of all changes since the last checkpoint

If the Namenode fails without HA, clients lose access to HDFS — even if DataNodes are functional.

---

#### Namenode High Availability Architecture

Namenode HA introduces:
- **Active Namenode**: Handles all client requests
- **Standby Namenode**: In sync but passive
- **Shared Journal (QJM or NFS)**: Ensures consistent edit logs between nodes
- **ZooKeeper Failover Controller (ZKFC)**: Manages automatic failover

```

#### Configuring Namenode HA

1. **Enable HA in core-site.xml**:

```xml
<property>
<name>fs.defaultFS</name>
<value>hdfs://cluster1</value>
</property>
<property>
<name>dfs.nameservices</name>
<value>cluster1</value>
</property>
<property>
<name>dfs.ha.namenodes.cluster1</name>
<value>nn1,nn2</value>
</property>
```

2. **Define Namenode RPC addresses**:

```xml
<property>
<name>dfs.namenode.rpc-address.cluster1.nn1</name>
<value>nn1-host:8020</value>
</property>
<property>
<name>dfs.namenode.rpc-address.cluster1.nn2</name>
<value>nn2-host:8020</value>
</property>
```

3. **Set shared edit directory using JournalNodes**:

```xml
<property>
<name>dfs.namenode.shared.edits.dir</name>
<value>qjournal://jn1:8485;jn2:8485;jn3:8485/cluster1</value>
</property>
```

4. **Enable automatic failover with ZKFC**:

```xml
<property>
<name>dfs.ha.automatic-failover.enabled</name>
<value>true</value>
</property>
```

Start ZKFC on both Namenodes to monitor and trigger failover.

---

#### Metadata Synchronization and Consistency

To keep the Standby Namenode in sync:

- It continuously reads the **edit logs** from JournalNodes
- It maintains its own **in-memory copy** of the metadata
- Upon failover, it becomes Active and serves client requests immediately

Checkpointing occurs periodically:
- The **FsImage** is updated from edit logs
- Both Active and Standby maintain consistent views

---

#### Failover and Recovery

**Failover** occurs automatically when:
- Active NN becomes unresponsive
- ZKFC detects failure via ZooKeeper heartbeat
- Standby NN is promoted to Active

**Manual failover** (for maintenance):

```bash
hdfs haadmin -failover nn1 nn2
```

Monitor failovers and sync health using:

```bash
hdfs haadmin -getServiceState nn1
hdfs haadmin -checkHealth nn2
```

---

#### Best Practices

- Use at least **3 JournalNodes** for quorum
- Deploy **ZKFC** on both Namenodes
- Store edit logs and FsImage on separate disks for durability
- Monitor metadata metrics using Prometheus or Cloudera Manager
- Backup metadata regularly via **hdfs dfsadmin -fetchImage**

---

#### Monitoring and Troubleshooting

- Use `hdfs fsck /` to verify metadata integrity
- Check ZKFC and JournalNode logs for failover events
- Use `jps` to confirm daemons (NN, DN, ZKFC, JournalNode) are running
- Audit metadata changes with Hadoop audit logs

---

#### Conclusion

High Availability for the Namenode is essential for building a **fault-tolerant Hadoop environment**. By configuring **HA with JournalNodes and ZKFC**, and ensuring **metadata synchronization** between Active and Standby nodes, you can deliver continuous access to HDFS — even in the face of hardware or network failures.

With proper setup and monitoring, Namenode HA ensures that **metadata — the heart of HDFS — is always available, consistent, and protected.**
