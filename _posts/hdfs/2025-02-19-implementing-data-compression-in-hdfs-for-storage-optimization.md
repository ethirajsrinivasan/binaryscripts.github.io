In big data environments, storage costs can escalate quickly as raw and processed data accumulates in the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). One of the most effective ways to control this growth is by implementing **data compression**.

HDFS supports several compression formats and file types that help reduce the size of stored data and improve processing speed by reducing disk and network I/O.

In this guide, we’ll explore how to implement **data compression in HDFS**, review common codecs and file formats, and share best practices for achieving optimal performance and storage efficiency.

#### Why Use Compression in HDFS?

Compression brings the following benefits:

- **Storage Savings**: Reduce the size of files on disk, saving terabytes or petabytes.
- **Faster I/O**: Smaller files mean less data to read/write, improving job performance.
- **Reduced Network Overhead**: Efficient for shuffle-heavy jobs and distributed computing.

Compression is essential for scaling Hadoop workloads affordably.

#### Compression Codecs Supported by Hadoop

Hadoop supports multiple compression codecs. Each has trade-offs between speed and compression ratio.

| Codec    | Compression Ratio | Speed       | Use Case                    |
|----------|-------------------|-------------|-----------------------------|
| Snappy   | Medium             | Very Fast   | Real-time, high-throughput  |
| Gzip     | High               | Slower      | Archival, cold storage      |
| Bzip2    | Very High          | Very Slow   | Historical data, rarely used |
| LZO      | Medium             | Fast        | HBase, streaming workloads  |
| Zlib     | High               | Medium      | Balanced workloads          |

Snappy and Gzip are the most commonly used for Hive and MapReduce jobs.

#### Using Compression with File Formats

HDFS compression is most effective when combined with **columnar storage formats** like **ORC** and **Parquet**.

##### ORC with Compression:

```sql
CREATE TABLE logs_orc (
user_id STRING,
activity STRING
)
STORED AS ORC
TBLPROPERTIES ("orc.compress" = "SNAPPY");
```

##### Parquet with Compression:

```sql
CREATE TABLE logs_parquet (
user_id STRING,
activity STRING
)
STORED AS PARQUET
TBLPROPERTIES ("parquet.compression" = "GZIP");
```

These formats support built-in compression and work well with Hive, Spark, and Presto.

---

#### Configuring Global Compression Settings

Enable output compression across the board by setting these properties in Hive or Hadoop:

```sql
SET hive.exec.compress.output=true;
SET mapreduce.output.fileoutputformat.compress=true;
SET mapreduce.output.fileoutputformat.compress.codec=org.apache.hadoop.io.compress.SnappyCodec;
```

For Gzip:

```sql
SET mapreduce.output.fileoutputformat.compress.codec=org.apache.hadoop.io.compress.GzipCodec;
```

These settings affect all subsequent MapReduce/Hive jobs.

#### Compressing Text Files in HDFS

Even flat files can be compressed before storage:

1. Compress locally:
   ```bash
   gzip large_logfile.txt
   ```

2. Upload to HDFS:
   ```bash
   hdfs dfs -put large_logfile.txt.gz /data/logs/
   ```

3. Query in Hive:
   ```sql
   CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE gzip_logs (
   line STRING
   )
   ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
   FIELDS TERMINATED BY '\t'
   STORED AS TEXTFILE
   LOCATION '/data/logs/';
   ```

Hive auto-decompresses Gzip and Bzip2 files.

---

#### Compression in MapReduce Workflows

Enable intermediate and output compression:

```xml
<property>
<name>mapreduce.map.output.compress</name>
<value>true</value>
</property>
<property>
<name>mapreduce.map.output.compress.codec</name>
<value>org.apache.hadoop.io.compress.SnappyCodec</value>
</property>
```

This reduces shuffle data and job runtime, especially on large joins or group-by operations.

---

#### Compression in HDFS Storage Policies

For large datasets, combine compression with **tiered storage** and **storage policies**:

- Store frequently accessed data in compressed ORC on fast disks
- Archive data in Gzip format in colder HDFS volumes

This approach balances cost and performance across the data lifecycle.

---

#### Best Practices for HDFS Compression

- Use **Snappy** for fast reads/writes and Spark compatibility
- Use **Gzip** for high compression on infrequent access datasets
- Prefer **ORC/Parquet** over flat files
- Avoid compressing small files — batch and compact first
- Benchmark performance and compression ratio before production use
- Enable **block-level compression** for large tables

#### Conclusion

Data compression is a must-have for any scalable Hadoop environment. Whether you're optimizing storage, accelerating queries, or reducing network overhead, applying the right compression strategy in HDFS can yield substantial performance and cost benefits.

By understanding codecs, file formats, and workload requirements, you can implement a compression plan that keeps your **HDFS efficient, fast, and affordable**.
