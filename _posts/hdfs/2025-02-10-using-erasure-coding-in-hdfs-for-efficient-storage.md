excerpt: Discover how to use erasure coding in HDFS to save storage space while maintaining fault tolerance. Learn how it works, when to use it, and how to configure it for efficient big data storage.

Traditional HDFS relies on **replication** (typically 3x) to provide data durability. While effective, this approach leads to high storage overhead â€” for every 1 TB of data, you need 3 TB of disk.

**Erasure Coding (EC)** offers a more efficient alternative. Introduced in Hadoop 3.0, EC can reduce storage overhead by up to **50%**, without sacrificing fault tolerance.

In this blog, we'll explore how **erasure coding in HDFS** works, when to use it, and how to configure it for **storage-efficient and resilient big data infrastructure**.

#### What is Erasure Coding?

Erasure coding is a method of **data protection** where files are split into data blocks and **parity blocks**, which can be used to reconstruct lost data.

- In HDFS, the default EC policy is **RS-6-3-1024k**:
  - 6 data blocks
  - 3 parity blocks
  - Block size: 1024 KB

Compared to 3x replication (200% overhead), RS-6-3 requires only **50% overhead**.

```
Original Data = 6 blocks
Parity Blocks = 3
Total Blocks Stored = 9
Overhead = 3/6 = 50%
```

#### How Erasure Coding Works in HDFS

1. A file is split into **data stripes**.
2. Each stripe is encoded into data + parity blocks.
3. Blocks are distributed across DataNodes.
4. If any blocks are lost, they can be **reconstructed** from the remaining blocks.

This allows HDFS to tolerate up to **3 block failures per stripe**, similar to triple replication.

#### Enabling Erasure Coding in HDFS

EC is disabled by default. To enable it:

1. List supported policies:

```bash
hdfs ec -listPolicies
```

2. Apply an EC policy to a directory:

```bash
hdfs ec -enablePolicy -policy RS-6-3-1024k
hdfs ec -setPolicy -path /data/warehouse -policy RS-6-3-1024k
```

Only new files written to `/data/warehouse` will use EC. Existing files remain unchanged.

---

#### Verifying Erasure-Coded Files

To confirm EC is applied:

```bash
hdfs ec -getPolicy -path /data/warehouse
hdfs fsck /data/warehouse -files -blocks -racks
```

Look for block types like `BLOCK_GROUP` in the output.

#### When to Use Erasure Coding

**Use EC for:**
- Cold or archival data
- Historical logs
- Large datasets with low read/write frequency

**Avoid EC for:**
- Small files (less than block size)
- Hot or frequently accessed data
- Random writes (not supported)

EC incurs higher **CPU and network overhead** during read/write and recovery, so it's best suited for **cold storage**.

#### Performance Considerations

| Factor           | Replication | Erasure Coding       |
|------------------|-------------|-----------------------|
| Storage Overhead | 200%        | 50% (RS-6-3)          |
| Write Speed      | Fast        | Slower (more CPU/network) |
| Read Speed       | Fast        | Slower (decode cost)  |
| Use Case         | Hot data    | Cold/archive data     |

To improve performance:
- Use EC on large files only
- Avoid using EC for files smaller than 100MB
- Use SSDs or tune memory buffers for encoding/decoding

---

#### Monitoring and Maintenance

Monitor EC-related health with:

```bash
hdfs dfsadmin -report
hdfs fsck /
```

Watch for:
- Block group health
- Corruption or uncorrectable failures
- Network load due to EC reconstruction

Use **block storage policies** to co-locate EC data on lower-cost hardware (HDDs).

---

#### Best Practices for Using Erasure Coding

- Apply EC only to **specific directories**
- **Benchmark** read/write performance before deploying to production
- Enable **kerberos and access control** to protect EC metadata
- Use **HDFS snapshots** for critical EC directories
- Regularly audit and validate EC health via `fsck`

---

#### Conclusion

Erasure coding in HDFS is a powerful feature that enables **cost-efficient storage** without compromising on fault tolerance. By understanding its benefits and trade-offs, you can apply EC strategically to reduce storage costs while ensuring data durability in your Hadoop ecosystem.

Used properly, EC can extend the lifespan of your data infrastructure and help meet the demands of ever-growing data volumes.
