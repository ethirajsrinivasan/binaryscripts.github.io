**Apache Flink** is a powerful open-source framework for **real-time stream processing** and **stateful computations**. While it excels at low-latency data processing, integrating it with persistent storage systems like **HDFS** is essential for durability, checkpointing, and data archiving.

In this blog, we’ll explore how to **use HDFS with Apache Flink**, enabling fault-tolerant streaming pipelines with persistent outputs and recoverable state. This integration is especially useful in production environments that require **exactly-once processing guarantees** and long-term storage of stream data.

#### Why Integrate HDFS with Flink?

Combining HDFS and Flink offers key advantages:

- **Durable state backend** for checkpoints and savepoints
- Long-term storage of processed data
- Integration with existing Hadoop-based data lakes
- Reliable recovery during failures
- Batch or downstream analytics using Hive/Spark

#### Writing Flink Output to HDFS

To write streaming output to HDFS, use the `StreamingFileSink` available in the Flink FileSystem API.

```java
StreamingFileSink<String> sink = StreamingFileSink
.forRowFormat(new Path("hdfs://namenode:8020/flink/output"), new SimpleStringEncoder<>("UTF-8"))
.withRollingPolicy(
DefaultRollingPolicy.builder()
.withRolloverInterval(Duration.ofMinutes(15))
.withInactivityInterval(Duration.ofMinutes(5))
.withMaxPartSize(128 * 1024 * 1024)
.build()
)
.build();

dataStream.addSink(sink);
```

The rolling policy controls when files are finalized and made available to downstream consumers like Hive.

---

#### HDFS as a State Backend for Checkpointing

Flink supports multiple state backends. For large state or long-running applications, use **HDFS-based checkpoints** via the `FileSystemStateBackend` or `RocksDBStateBackend`.

```java
env.enableCheckpointing(60000); // 1-minute interval
env.setStateBackend(new FileSystemStateBackend("hdfs://namenode:8020/flink/checkpoints"));
```

Or with RocksDB:

```java
env.setStateBackend(new RocksDBStateBackend("hdfs://namenode:8020/flink/checkpoints", true));
```

This allows Flink to **recover from failures** using persisted state on HDFS.

---

#### Setting Up HDFS Access in Flink

1. Ensure `hadoop-common` and `hadoop-hdfs` dependencies are in Flink’s classpath.
2. Add `core-site.xml` and `hdfs-site.xml` to `$FLINK_HOME/conf/` or ship them with your application JAR.
3. Confirm HDFS connectivity:

```bash
hdfs dfs -ls hdfs://namenode:8020/
```

Set HDFS permissions to allow Flink job access, especially for checkpointing and sink directories.

---

#### Example: Kafka to HDFS Streaming Pipeline

```java
StreamExecutionEnvironment env = StreamExecutionEnvironment.getExecutionEnvironment();
env.enableCheckpointing(30000); // every 30 seconds

FlinkKafkaConsumer<String> kafkaSource = new FlinkKafkaConsumer<>(
"events",
new SimpleStringSchema(),
kafkaProps
);

DataStream<String> stream = env.addSource(kafkaSource);

StreamingFileSink<String> hdfsSink = StreamingFileSink
.forRowFormat(new Path("hdfs://namenode:8020/streams/events"), new SimpleStringEncoder<>("UTF-8"))
.withRollingPolicy(DefaultRollingPolicy.builder()
.withRolloverInterval(Duration.ofMinutes(10))
.build())
.build();

stream.addSink(hdfsSink);

env.execute("Kafka to HDFS Pipeline");
```

This pipeline reads messages from Kafka and writes them to HDFS in rolling files, with checkpointing for fault tolerance.

---

#### Integration with Hive and Downstream Analytics

Once Flink writes data to HDFS, Hive or Spark can pick it up for batch processing or analytics.

Example Hive external table:

```sql
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE stream_events (
event STRING
)
STORED AS TEXTFILE
LOCATION 'hdfs://namenode:8020/streams/events';
```

For ORC/Parquet output, use the appropriate Flink formats via Table API or connectors.

---

#### Monitoring and Fault Tolerance

- Enable **checkpointing metrics** in Flink dashboard
- Store checkpoints on **dedicated HDFS directories** with proper ACLs
- Tune `minPauseBetweenCheckpoints`, `timeout`, and `maxConcurrentCheckpoints` for stability
- Use **HA JobManager** with ZooKeeper for production-grade recovery

---

#### Best Practices

- Use **RocksDB** with HDFS backend for large stateful jobs
- Avoid small file problems — use appropriate **rolling policy**
- Secure HDFS with **Kerberos** if running in secure environments
- Set up **retention policies** on checkpoint directories to avoid disk bloat
- Use `withBucketAssigner()` to write partitioned output by time, user, etc.

#### Conclusion

Integrating **Apache Flink with HDFS** gives you the power of real-time stream processing with the durability and scalability of Hadoop. Whether you're building streaming ETL, IoT pipelines, or log processors, this combination provides a strong foundation for **fault-tolerant, stateful streaming applications**.

By following the right architecture and tuning, you can deliver **reliable low-latency pipelines** that scale across distributed environments — while ensuring data durability and downstream compatibility with batch systems.
