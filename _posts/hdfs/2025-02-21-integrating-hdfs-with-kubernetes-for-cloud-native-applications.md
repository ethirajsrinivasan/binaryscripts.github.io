As organizations modernize their infrastructure, **Kubernetes** has become the de facto standard for container orchestration. Meanwhile, **HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System)** remains a trusted foundation for scalable, high-throughput storage in big data environments.

But what if you want to bring the power of HDFS into your cloud-native workflows?

This post explores how to **integrate HDFS with Kubernetes**, enabling you to combine Kubernetes agility with HDFS durability and performance — unlocking hybrid and cloud-native big data processing.

---

#### Why Integrate HDFS with Kubernetes?

Kubernetes is designed for stateless workloads, while HDFS is a **stateful, distributed storage system**. Integrating the two allows you to:

- Run **data-intensive applications** (e.g., Spark, Hive, Presto) in containers
- Support **persistent, high-throughput storage** within Kubernetes
- Build **hybrid cloud and edge storage solutions**
- Migrate legacy big data apps into containerized environments

---

#### Deployment Strategies

There are three main approaches to using HDFS with Kubernetes:

1. **Deploy HDFS inside Kubernetes**
2. **Access external HDFS from Kubernetes apps**
3. **Use CSI drivers to provision HDFS as volumes**

Each method has trade-offs in terms of complexity, performance, and fault tolerance.

#### 1. Deploying HDFS on Kubernetes

You can containerize the HDFS components:

- **NameNode**
- **DataNode**
- **JournalNode (for HA)**
- **Zookeeper (optional for HA failover)**

Use a Kubernetes **StatefulSet** to manage each node:

Example: `namenode-statefulset.yaml`

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
name: hdfs-namenode
spec:
serviceName: "hdfs-namenode"
replicas: 1
selector:
matchLabels:
app: hdfs-namenode
template:
metadata:
labels:
app: hdfs-namenode
spec:
containers:
- name: namenode
image: hadoop:latest
ports:
- containerPort: 8020
- containerPort: 50070
volumeMounts:
- name: hdfs-nn-data
mountPath: /hadoop/dfs/name
volumeClaimTemplates:
- metadata:
name: hdfs-nn-data
spec:
accessModes: ["ReadWriteOnce"]
resources:
requests:
storage: 100Gi
```

Repeat similar setup for **datanode StatefulSets**, using `dfs.datanode.data.dir`.

---

#### 2. Accessing External HDFS from Kubernetes

If you already have an HDFS cluster outside Kubernetes, you can **mount it as a client** in your pods.

Steps:
- Add HDFS config files (`core-site.xml`, `hdfs-site.xml`) to your container images or as ConfigMaps
- Mount them inside pods via volume
- Ensure pods can resolve and access HDFS NameNode/ports
- Use `hadoop fs` or client libraries in your apps

Useful for:
- Analytics platforms (e.g., Spark on K8s) reading from centralized HDFS
- Sharing datasets across cloud and on-prem environments

---

#### 3. HDFS CSI Driver (Experimental)

A **Container Storage Interface (CSI)** driver for HDFS allows dynamic provisioning of HDFS-backed Persistent Volumes.

Projects like [fluid](https://github.com/fluid-cloudnative/fluid) and [csi-hdfs](https://github.com/Intel-bigdata/SSM) aim to bridge this gap.

Example PersistentVolume:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
name: hdfs-pv
spec:
capacity:
storage: 500Gi
accessModes:
- ReadWriteMany
csi:
driver: hdfs.csi.hadoop.com
volumeHandle: hdfs-volume
volumeAttributes:
hdfs.path: "/user/data"
hdfs.namenode: "hdfs://namenode-service:8020"
```

Note: CSI for HDFS is still evolving and may require customization.

---

#### Networking and Configuration Considerations

- Use **headless services** to expose StatefulSets
- Set environment variables for **HADOOP_CONF_DIR** inside containers
- Use **ConfigMaps** to inject `core-site.xml` and `hdfs-site.xml`
- Ensure **persistent volumes** for NameNode and DataNode data
- Enable **Kerberos authentication** in secure environments

---

#### Monitoring and Maintenance

Use Prometheus-compatible exporters and sidecars:

- **JMX Exporter** for HDFS metrics
- Integrate with **Grafana**, **Datadog**, or **OpenTelemetry**

Logs can be routed via **Fluentd or Logstash** to ELK or Loki for observability.

---

#### Real-World Use Cases

1. **Kubernetes-native Spark on HDFS**  
   Run Spark jobs in K8s using HDFS as the backend storage

2. **Hybrid Cloud Data Lakes**  
   Keep active data on-prem HDFS, archive to S3 — all accessed from K8s

3. **Edge-to-Core Pipelines**  
   Use lightweight HDFS clusters on edge nodes (e.g., K3s) and sync to central HDFS

4. **CI/CD for Data Pipelines**  
   Build test environments with ephemeral HDFS clusters inside Kubernetes for safe iteration

---

#### Best Practices

- Use **StatefulSets** with volumeClaimTemplates for HDFS persistence
- Isolate DataNodes per availability zone to improve fault tolerance
- Mount HDFS as an external service for simpler cluster ops
- Backup critical NameNode metadata regularly
- Use **anti-affinity rules** to spread DataNodes across nodes

---

#### Conclusion

Bringing HDFS into Kubernetes environments opens the door to **cloud-native big data workflows**. Whether you're running Spark, Presto, Hive, or ML pipelines, HDFS provides the **high-throughput storage layer** many applications need.

By choosing the right integration method — internal deployment, external access, or CSI — you can modernize your storage architecture while retaining the scalability and durability HDFS is known for.
