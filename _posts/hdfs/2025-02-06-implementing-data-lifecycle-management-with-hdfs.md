As big data platforms scale to petabyte-level storage, managing the **entire lifecycle of data** becomes critical for performance, compliance, and cost efficiency. Without proper governance, Hadoop clusters are often filled with outdated, duplicate, or rarely used datasets that inflate storage costs and increase maintenance overhead.

This post explores how to implement **Data Lifecycle Management (DLM) in HDFS**, including strategies for data retention, tiered storage, archiving, and automated purging of obsolete data.

#### What is Data Lifecycle Management?

Data Lifecycle Management refers to the **automated policies and processes** used to manage data from ingestion to deletion, including:

- **Retention**: How long data is stored
- **Archiving**: Moving cold/infrequently accessed data to cheaper storage
- **Deletion**: Automatically removing expired or redundant files
- **Tiered storage**: Distributing data across different types of hardware based on usage

DLM ensures **optimal resource utilization** and supports **regulatory compliance** (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).

---

#### HDFS Architecture Support for DLM

HDFS offers native features to support lifecycle policies:

- **Directory-based organization**
- **Timestamps for age-based policies**
- **Tiered storage with Storage Policies**
- **Integration with Oozie, Falcon, or custom scripts for automation**
- **HDFS snapshots** for audit/compliance use cases

---

#### Setting Up Retention Policies

A retention policy determines how long data should be kept before it is archived or deleted.

You can implement retention using:
- **File naming conventions** (e.g., with dates)
- **Metadata tags** stored in Hive or HBase
- **Automated cleanup scripts** (e.g., shell, Python, Oozie)

Example bash script to delete 90-day-old files:

```bash
hdfs dfs -find /data/logs -type f -mtime +90 -delete
```

Schedule this with **cron** or **Apache Oozie** for periodic cleanup.

---

#### Automating Archival with HDFS Storage Policies

HDFS supports **storage tiering** using the `dfs.storage.policy` setting.

Available policies:
- `HOT`: Frequently accessed data
- `COLD`: Less-accessed data
- `WARM`: Balanced
- `ALL_SSD`, `ONE_SSD`, `LAZY_PERSIST`: For fast storage

Set a policy:

```bash
hdfs storagepolicies -setStoragePolicy -path /data/archive -policy COLD
```

Data in `/data/archive` will now be stored on low-cost disks (e.g., HDDs instead of SSDs).

---

#### Using Snapshots for Compliance and Backup

HDFS snapshots allow **point-in-time copies** of directories without duplicating data.

Enable snapshots:

```bash
hdfs dfsadmin -allowSnapshot /data/secure
hdfs dfs -createSnapshot /data/secure backup_2024_04_01
```

Snapshots:
- Are read-only and immutable
- Useful for legal holds and rollback
- Consume minimal space due to block-level tracking

Delete old snapshots based on policy:

```bash
hdfs dfs -deleteSnapshot /data/secure backup_2023_01_01
```

---

#### Integrating Falcon/Oozie for Lifecycle Workflows

While now deprecated, **Apache Falcon** was designed specifically for data lifecycle and can still be useful in legacy environments.

Modern alternative: Use **Apache Oozie** or **Apache NiFi** to:
- Trigger retention workflows
- Automate tiering and cleanup
- Maintain logs and audit trails

You can also build custom workflows using **Airflow**, **Dagster**, or **Shell scripts**.

---

#### Monitoring and Auditing

To ensure DLM is functioning correctly:
- Use **Ranger** or **Audit logs** for tracking access/deletion
- Use **Ambari/Cloudera Manager** or Prometheus/Grafana for storage metrics
- Log each lifecycle action for compliance reviews

Track size changes:

```bash
hdfs dfs -du -h /data | sort -hr | head -n 10
```

---

#### Best Practices for HDFS Lifecycle Management

- Tag data with creation and expiration timestamps
- Separate hot/warm/cold data using directory structure
- Implement and test automated archival/deletion scripts
- Regularly review retention policies with legal/compliance teams
- Leverage snapshots for backup and rollback
- Use quotas to limit runaway storage growth

---

#### Conclusion

Data Lifecycle Management in HDFS is essential for sustainable and compliant big data infrastructure. By combining **retention policies**, **tiered storage**, **snapshotting**, and **automated workflows**, organizations can ensure their Hadoop clusters remain lean, performant, and audit-ready.

Whether you're managing raw ingestion logs, transformed analytics tables, or archival snapshots â€” implementing proper lifecycle strategies helps you **scale efficiently and cost-effectively**.
