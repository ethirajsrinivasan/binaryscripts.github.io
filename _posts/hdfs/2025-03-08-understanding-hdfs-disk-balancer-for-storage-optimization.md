In Hadoop HDFS, ensuring balanced storage across the cluster is crucial for performance and fault tolerance. While the `hdfs balancer` tool balances **data across DataNodes**, there's another less-known but powerful utility called **Disk Balancer**, which balances data **within** a DataNode across its multiple disks.

Imbalanced disk usage within a DataNode can lead to:
- Local disk bottlenecks
- Uneven disk wear
- Underutilized capacity
- Reduced I/O throughput

This post explores how the **HDFS Disk Balancer** works, how to configure and use it, and best practices for maintaining optimal **intra-node storage utilization**.

---

#### What Is HDFS Disk Balancer?

The **Disk Balancer** is a command-line utility introduced in Hadoop 2.7 to **distribute blocks evenly across all disks in a DataNode**.

While the regular `hdfs balancer` operates at the cluster level, the Disk Balancer addresses **disk skew** on individual nodes — a common issue when disks are added, replaced, or fail.

---

#### When to Use Disk Balancer

Use Disk Balancer when:
- A DataNode contains disks with uneven utilization
- Disks are replaced or newly added to existing nodes
- You observe local I/O bottlenecks in monitoring tools
- Storage policies change (e.g., SSD vs HDD segregation)

Imbalanced disk usage can affect:
- HDFS write performance (uneven block placement)
- Read throughput (some disks overutilized)
- Long-term disk health (uneven wear)

---

#### How Disk Balancer Works

Disk Balancer:
1. Analyzes the usage across all volumes on a DataNode
2. Generates a **plan** for redistributing blocks
3. Moves HDFS blocks from overutilized to underutilized disks
4. Ensures that no data is lost or corrupted during the move

It operates **non-intrusively** and throttles I/O usage to avoid impacting active workloads.

---

#### Step-by-Step: Using Disk Balancer

**Step 1: Analyze Disk Utilization**

```bash
hdfs diskbalancer -report
```

This command provides a utilization breakdown of each volume within the DataNode.

**Step 2: Generate Disk Balancing Plan**

```bash
hdfs diskbalancer -plan <DataNode_UUID> -out /tmp/plan.json
```

- Replace `<DataNode_UUID>` with the actual UUID of the DataNode.
- Use `hdfs dfsadmin -report` to find UUIDs.

**Step 3: Execute the Plan**

```bash
hdfs diskbalancer -execute /tmp/plan.json
```

The Disk Balancer begins redistributing blocks per the generated plan.

**Step 4: Monitor Progress**

Progress is logged to standard output and logs (e.g., `/var/log/hadoop/hdfs`).

#### Configuration Parameters

Key tunables (can be added to `hdfs-site.xml`):

```xml
<property>
<name>dfs.disk.balancer.max.disk.throughputInMBperSec</name>
<value>10</value>
</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.disk.balancer.block.tolerance.percent</name>
  <value>10</value>
</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.disk.balancer.max.disk.errors</name>
  <value>5</value>
</property>
```

These control:
- I/O throttling
- Block movement sensitivity
- Tolerance for skipping bad disks

---

#### Safety and Performance Considerations

- Disk Balancer is **safe**: data is only moved after integrity checks
- Works **online**: no downtime required
- Run during **off-peak hours** to minimize interference
- Avoid running Disk Balancer concurrently with large HDFS balancer jobs

You can **pause** or **abort** execution if needed:

```bash
hdfs diskbalancer -cancel <planID>
```

#### Disk Balancer vs HDFS Balancer

| Feature                  | HDFS Balancer              | Disk Balancer                      |
|--------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Scope                    | Across DataNodes           | Within a single DataNode           |
| Goal                     | Equalize node utilization  | Equalize disk utilization          |
| Trigger                  | Skewed node usage          | Skewed local disk usage            |
| Common Use Case          | Cluster-level optimization | Local optimization after disk add/remove |

Use **both tools** together for complete HDFS health and optimization.

---

#### Best Practices

- Regularly monitor disk usage with `hdfs dfsadmin -report`
- Run Disk Balancer after adding/removing disks
- Automate health checks for per-disk utilization
- Document UUIDs and hardware changes per DataNode
- Set throughput limits to avoid job contention
- Schedule jobs during maintenance windows if moving large data volumes

---

#### Conclusion

As HDFS clusters grow and evolve, **disk skew** within DataNodes can quietly degrade performance and increase hardware wear. The **HDFS Disk Balancer** provides a powerful yet lightweight way to keep local disk usage optimized — ensuring better **I/O throughput**, **fault tolerance**, and **resource efficiency**.

Make it part of your **cluster tuning toolkit** to maintain a high-performing and balanced Hadoop ecosystem.
