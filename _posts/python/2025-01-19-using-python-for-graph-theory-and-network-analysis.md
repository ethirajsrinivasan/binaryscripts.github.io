Graph theory is a **fundamental concept in computer science and mathematics**, with applications in **social networks, supply chains, recommendation systems, and biological networks**. Python provides **powerful libraries** like **NetworkX**, **Graph-tool**, and **iGraph** to efficiently work with **graphs, nodes, edges, and algorithms**.

In this guide, we‚Äôll cover:  
‚úî **Graph representations in Python**  
‚úî **Common graph algorithms**  
‚úî **Network analysis techniques**  
‚úî **Graph visualization**

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Understanding Graphs in Python

A **graph** is a collection of **nodes (vertices)** and **edges (connections)**. There are two main types:  
‚úî **Directed Graph (DiGraph)** ‚Äì Edges have a direction (e.g., social media followers)  
‚úî **Undirected Graph (Graph)** ‚Äì Edges are bidirectional (e.g., friendships)

### Installing Required Libraries

To get started, install **NetworkX** for graph processing and **Matplotlib** for visualization:

```bash
pip install networkx matplotlib
```

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Creating Graphs with NetworkX

Let‚Äôs create a **basic graph** and visualize it using **Matplotlib**.

### Example: Building and Plotting a Graph

```python
import networkx as nx  
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create an undirected graph
G = nx.Graph()

# Add nodes
G.add_nodes_from(["A", "B", "C", "D"])

# Add edges
G.add_edges_from([("A", "B"), ("B", "C"), ("C", "D"), ("A", "D")])

# Draw the graph
nx.draw(G, with_labels=True, node_color="skyblue", edge_color="black", node_size=2000, font_size=14)  
plt.show()  
```

‚úî **Why NetworkX?** ‚Äì It provides a **simple and efficient way** to work with graphs.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Graph Traversal Algorithms

Graph traversal is essential for **searching, pathfinding, and connectivity analysis**.

üîπ **Common Graph Traversal Algorithms:**  
‚úî **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** ‚Äì Explores neighbors first (shortest path in unweighted graphs)  
‚úî **Depth-First Search (DFS)** ‚Äì Explores as deep as possible before backtracking

### Example: BFS and DFS in Python

```python
from collections import deque

def bfs(graph, start):  
visited = set()  
queue = deque([start])

    while queue:  
        node = queue.popleft()  
        if node not in visited:  
            print(node, end=" ")  
            visited.add(node)  
            queue.extend(graph[node] - visited)  

def dfs(graph, start, visited=set()):  
if start not in visited:  
print(start, end=" ")  
visited.add(start)  
for neighbor in graph[start]:  
dfs(graph, neighbor, visited)

# Graph as adjacency list
graph = {  
"A": {"B", "D"},  
"B": {"A", "C"},  
"C": {"B", "D"},  
"D": {"A", "C"}  
}

print("BFS Traversal:")  
bfs(graph, "A")

print("\nDFS Traversal:")  
dfs(graph, "A")  
```

‚úî **Use BFS** for **shortest path** and **level-order traversal**.  
‚úî **Use DFS** for **connected components and cycle detection**.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Finding Shortest Paths in Graphs

Shortest path algorithms are crucial for **routing, logistics, and AI**.

üîπ **Popular Algorithms:**  
‚úî **Dijkstra's Algorithm** ‚Äì Finds the shortest path in weighted graphs  
‚úî **Bellman-Ford Algorithm** ‚Äì Handles graphs with **negative weights**  
‚úî **A\*** ‚Äì Best for heuristic-based pathfinding

### Example: Dijkstra‚Äôs Algorithm in NetworkX

```python
G = nx.Graph()  
edges = [("A", "B", 4), ("A", "C", 2), ("B", "C", 1), ("B", "D", 5), ("C", "D", 8)]

# Add weighted edges
G.add_weighted_edges_from(edges)

# Compute shortest path
shortest_path = nx.dijkstra_path(G, source="A", target="D")

print("Shortest Path from A to D:", shortest_path)  
```

‚úî **Why Dijkstra?** ‚Äì It efficiently finds the shortest path in **weighted graphs**.

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Detecting Graph Components & Cycles

üîπ **Key Graph Properties:**  
‚úî **Connected Components** ‚Äì Isolated subgraphs  
‚úî **Cycle Detection** ‚Äì Detects loops in graphs

### Example: Finding Connected Components

```python
G = nx.Graph()  
G.add_edges_from([("A", "B"), ("C", "D")])

components = list(nx.connected_components(G))  
print("Connected Components:", components)  
```

‚úî **Why Components?** ‚Äì Helps in **cluster analysis**.

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Network Centrality & Influence Analysis

Centrality measures **identify key nodes** in networks:  
‚úî **Degree Centrality** ‚Äì Number of direct connections  
‚úî **Betweenness Centrality** ‚Äì Nodes that bridge communities  
‚úî **PageRank** ‚Äì Google's algorithm for ranking importance

### Example: Computing PageRank

```python
G = nx.DiGraph()  
G.add_edges_from([("A", "B"), ("A", "C"), ("B", "D"), ("C", "D"), ("D", "A")])

pagerank_scores = nx.pagerank(G)  
print("PageRank Scores:", pagerank_scores)  
```

‚úî **Why PageRank?** ‚Äì It powers **search engine ranking** and **influencer detection**.

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Graph Visualization with NetworkX & Matplotlib

Graph visualization helps **understand complex relationships**.

### Example: Plotting a Directed Graph

```python
G = nx.DiGraph()  
G.add_edges_from([("A", "B"), ("A", "C"), ("B", "D"), ("C", "D"), ("D", "A")])

plt.figure(figsize=(6, 6))  
nx.draw(G, with_labels=True, node_color="lightblue", edge_color="gray", node_size=2000, font_size=12)  
plt.show()  
```

‚úî **Why Visualization?** ‚Äì Helps in **social network analysis, fraud detection, and biology**.
