Debugging is a crucial skill for any Python developer, whether you're working on data engineering, machine learning, or backend systems. Using **advanced debugging techniques** can help you quickly diagnose and fix issues, leading to **efficient and optimized** code.

This guide will explore **powerful Python debugging tools and methods**, from built-in debuggers like `pdb` to advanced profilers and memory analysis tools.

#### Why Master Python Debugging?

âœ… **Speeds up development** by identifying issues faster  
âœ… **Optimizes performance** by detecting bottlenecks  
âœ… **Reduces bugs in production** through effective logging and monitoring  
âœ… **Enhances code maintainability** with structured debugging practices

---

#### 1. Using the Built-in Python Debugger (PDB)

Pythonâ€™s built-in **PDB (Python Debugger)** allows you to step through code interactively.

##### Setting a Breakpoint

```python  
import pdb

def divide(a, b):  
pdb.set_trace()  # Debugger starts here  
return a / b

result = divide(10, 0)  
```

When executed, PDB stops at `set_trace()`, allowing you to inspect variables and step through execution.

##### Useful PDB Commands

| Command  | Description |
|----------|------------|
| `n` | Move to the next line |
| `s` | Step into a function |
| `c` | Continue execution |
| `q` | Quit debugger |
| `p variable` | Print a variable value |

---

#### 2. Enhanced Debugging with `ipdb`

`ipdb` provides a better interface for debugging with syntax highlighting.

Install it with:

```sh  
pip install ipdb  
```

Replace `pdb.set_trace()` with `import ipdb; ipdb.set_trace()` for an **improved debugging experience**.

---

#### 3. Logging for Effective Debugging

Instead of using `print()`, **structured logging** provides more insights.

##### Basic Logging

```python  
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG, format="%(levelname)s: %(message)s")

def divide(a, b):  
if b == 0:  
logging.error("Division by zero is not allowed!")  
return None  
return a / b

result = divide(10, 0)  
```

âœ” Helps diagnose issues without modifying code logic  
âœ” Supports multiple logging levels (`DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`)

---

#### 4. Using PySnooper for Auto Debugging

`PySnooper` **automatically logs function execution** without modifying the code.

Install it with:

```sh  
pip install pysnooper  
```

Use it as a **decorator**:

```python  
import pysnooper

@pysnooper.snoop()  
def multiply(a, b):  
return a * b

result = multiply(5, 3)  
```

âœ” **Tracks variable changes** and execution flow automatically

---

#### 5. Profiling Performance with cProfile

To analyze function execution time, use `cProfile`:

```python  
import cProfile

def slow_function():  
sum([i ** 2 for i in range(1000000)])

cProfile.run("slow_function()")  
```

âœ” Helps detect **performance bottlenecks**

For better visualization, install `snakeviz`:

```sh  
pip install snakeviz  
```

Run:

```sh  
python -m cProfile -o output.prof myscript.py  
snakeviz output.prof  
```

âœ” Generates an **interactive profile graph**

---

#### 6. Detecting Memory Leaks with `memory_profiler`

Install `memory_profiler`:

```sh  
pip install memory_profiler  
```

Profile a functionâ€™s memory usage:

```python  
from memory_profiler import profile

@profile  
def large_list():  
return [i for i in range(10**6)]

large_list()  
```

âœ” Helps identify **memory-hungry operations**

---

#### 7. Real-Time CPU and Memory Monitoring with `PySpy`

`PySpy` is a lightweight profiler for monitoring running Python processes.

Install:

```sh  
pip install py-spy  
```

Run real-time profiling:

```sh  
py-spy top --pid <process_id>  
```

âœ” **Monitors CPU usage** without modifying the code

---

#### Best Practices for Debugging in Python

âœ” Use **breakpoints** (`pdb`, `ipdb`) to step through code  
âœ” Implement **structured logging** instead of print statements  
âœ” Leverage **profilers** (`cProfile`, `PySpy`) to optimize performance  
âœ” Detect **memory issues** using `memory_profiler`  
âœ” Automate debugging with `PySnooper`

---

#### Conclusion

Mastering **advanced Python debugging techniques** can **save time and improve code quality**. Whether you use `PDB` for interactive debugging, `PySnooper` for auto-tracing, or `cProfile` for performance tuning, the right tools make debugging **efficient and insightful**.
