Effective error logging and monitoring are crucial for building resilient Python applications. Logging helps capture errors, monitor application health, and troubleshoot issues, while monitoring tools provide real-time insights. In this post, weâ€™ll explore best practices, advanced logging strategies, and monitoring integrations to keep your Python applications running smoothly.

#### Why Is Advanced Error Logging Important?

Basic print statements wonâ€™t cut it for production applications. **Advanced logging** helps in:

- Capturing **structured logs** for better debugging
- Integrating with **centralized logging systems** (e.g., ELK, Splunk)
- Reducing noise with **log levels** (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
- Monitoring errors in **real-time** using external tools
- Sending **alerts** when critical issues occur

---

#### Setting Up Pythonâ€™s Built-in Logging

Python provides a powerful logging module that supports different log levels and handlers.

```python  
import logging

logging.basicConfig(  
level=logging.INFO,  
format="%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s",  
handlers=[logging.FileHandler("app.log"), logging.StreamHandler()]  
)

logging.info("Application started")  
logging.error("An error occurred!")  
```

Hereâ€™s whatâ€™s happening:  
âœ… Logs are saved to `app.log` and printed to the console.  
âœ… Uses a **structured format** with timestamps and log levels.  
âœ… Supports multiple log destinations (console, file, etc.).

---

#### Using JSON Logging for Better Observability

Structured logging using JSON format makes logs machine-readable and easy to analyze.

```python  
import logging  
import json

class JSONFormatter(logging.Formatter):  
def format(self, record):  
log_message = {  
"timestamp": self.formatTime(record),  
"level": record.levelname,  
"message": record.getMessage(),  
}  
return json.dumps(log_message)

logger = logging.getLogger("jsonLogger")  
handler = logging.StreamHandler()  
handler.setFormatter(JSONFormatter())  
logger.addHandler(handler)

logger.error("Database connection failed")  
```

This ensures logs are **structured and easy to process** in log aggregation systems.

---

#### Logging Exceptions with Stack Traces

Capturing stack traces helps in pinpointing errors.

```python  
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.ERROR, format="%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s")

try:  
1 / 0  
except Exception as e:  
logging.exception("Unhandled exception occurred")  
```

âœ… The `logging.exception` method logs the **full stack trace**, making debugging easier.

---

#### Centralized Logging with ELK Stack

For production applications, logs need to be centralized using tools like **Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana (ELK)**.

1. **Install Filebeat** to collect logs.
2. **Send logs to Logstash**, which parses and enriches data.
3. **Store logs in Elasticsearch** for querying.
4. **Visualize logs in Kibana** for real-time insights.

Example **Filebeat configuration** to ship Python logs:

```yml  
filebeat.inputs:
- type: log  
  paths:
  - /var/log/python_app.log

output.elasticsearch:  
hosts: ["http://localhost:9200"]  
```

This enables **searchable, structured logs** for debugging at scale.

---

#### Error Monitoring with Sentry

[Sentry](https://sentry.io/) provides real-time error tracking and alerting.

To integrate Sentry with Python:

```sh  
pip install sentry-sdk  
```

```python  
import sentry_sdk

sentry_sdk.init(  
dsn="https://your_sentry_dsn",  
traces_sample_rate=1.0  
)

try:  
1 / 0  
except ZeroDivisionError:  
sentry_sdk.capture_exception()  
```

âœ… Captures unhandled exceptions and sends them to Sentryâ€™s dashboard.  
âœ… Provides **error grouping, stack traces, and performance monitoring**.

---

#### Asynchronous Logging with Celery

For high-performance applications, **async logging** prevents blocking the main thread.

```python  
from celery import Celery  
import logging

app = Celery("tasks", broker="redis://localhost:6379/0")

@app.task  
def log_error(message):  
logging.error(message)

log_error.delay("Background logging task")  
```

âœ… Uses Celery to offload logging to background workers.

---

#### Log Rotation to Prevent Disk Overflow

Large log files can consume disk space. **Log rotation** helps manage log size.

```python  
from logging.handlers import RotatingFileHandler

handler = RotatingFileHandler("app.log", maxBytes=1024 * 1024 * 5, backupCount=5)  
logging.getLogger().addHandler(handler)  
```

âœ… Keeps logs manageable by rotating when they reach **5MB**.

---

#### Best Practices for Error Logging & Monitoring

âœ” **Use structured logs** (JSON format) for easy parsing.  
âœ” **Capture stack traces** with `logging.exception()`.  
âœ” **Integrate with ELK or cloud-based log aggregators**.  
âœ” **Set up alerts** for critical issues with Sentry.  
âœ” **Enable log rotation** to manage file sizes.  
âœ” **Use async logging** to prevent performance bottlenecks.

#### Conclusion

Advanced error logging and monitoring are essential for maintaining reliable Python applications. By leveraging structured logging, centralized monitoring tools, and real-time alerting systems, you can **improve observability and troubleshoot errors efficiently**.
