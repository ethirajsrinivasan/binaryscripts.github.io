Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is at the heart of Python, enabling developers to write clean, reusable, and scalable code. Design patterns provide time-tested solutions to common software design challenges. In this guide, we will explore key object-oriented design patterns in Python, along with practical examples and best practices.

#### What Are Design Patterns?

Design patterns are reusable solutions to recurring software design problems. They help developers adhere to best practices, improve code maintainability, and facilitate collaboration.

There are three main categories of design patterns:

- **Creational Patterns** – Handling object creation efficiently
- **Structural Patterns** – Defining relationships between classes and objects
- **Behavioral Patterns** – Managing communication between objects

Let's explore some essential patterns in each category.

#### Creational Design Patterns

##### **1. Singleton Pattern**

The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global access point to it.

```python  
class Singleton:  
_instance = None

    def __new__(cls):  
        if cls._instance is None:  
            cls._instance = super().__new__(cls)  
        return cls._instance  

# Usage
singleton1 = Singleton()  
singleton2 = Singleton()  
print(singleton1 is singleton2)  # True  
```

##### **2. Factory Pattern**

The Factory pattern allows object creation without specifying the exact class.

```python  
class Animal:  
def speak(self):  
pass

class Dog(Animal):  
def speak(self):  
return "Woof!"

class Cat(Animal):  
def speak(self):  
return "Meow!"

class AnimalFactory:  
@staticmethod  
def get_animal(animal_type):  
animals = {"dog": Dog, "cat": Cat}  
return animals.get(animal_type, Animal)()

# Usage
animal = AnimalFactory.get_animal("dog")  
print(animal.speak())  # Woof!  
```

#### Structural Design Patterns

##### **3. Adapter Pattern**

The Adapter pattern allows incompatible interfaces to work together.

```python  
class OldSystem:  
def old_method(self):  
return "Old system output"

class Adapter:  
def __init__(self, old_system):  
self.old_system = old_system

    def new_method(self):  
        return self.old_system.old_method()  

# Usage
adapter = Adapter(OldSystem())  
print(adapter.new_method())  # Old system output  
```

##### **4. Decorator Pattern**

The Decorator pattern dynamically adds behavior to objects without modifying their code.

```python  
def uppercase_decorator(func):  
def wrapper():  
return func().upper()  
return wrapper

@uppercase_decorator  
def greet():  
return "hello world"

print(greet())  # HELLO WORLD  
```

---

#### Behavioral Design Patterns

##### **5. Observer Pattern**

The Observer pattern allows objects to be notified of changes in another object’s state.

```python  
class Subject:  
def __init__(self):  
self._observers = []

    def attach(self, observer):  
        self._observers.append(observer)  

    def notify(self, message):  
        for observer in self._observers:  
            observer.update(message)  

class Observer:  
def update(self, message):  
print(f"Received update: {message}")

# Usage
subject = Subject()  
observer1 = Observer()  
observer2 = Observer()

subject.attach(observer1)  
subject.attach(observer2)  
subject.notify("New Event!")  
```

##### **6. Strategy Pattern**

The Strategy pattern allows selecting an algorithm at runtime.

```python  
class Strategy:  
def execute(self):  
pass

class ConcreteStrategyA(Strategy):  
def execute(self):  
return "Strategy A executed"

class ConcreteStrategyB(Strategy):  
def execute(self):  
return "Strategy B executed"

class Context:  
def __init__(self, strategy):  
self.strategy = strategy

    def execute_strategy(self):  
        return self.strategy.execute()  

# Usage
context = Context(ConcreteStrategyA())  
print(context.execute_strategy())  # Strategy A executed

context.strategy = ConcreteStrategyB()  
print(context.execute_strategy())  # Strategy B executed  
```

#### Best Practices for Using Design Patterns

- **Use design patterns when needed** – Avoid over-engineering by applying patterns only when they add value.
- **Keep code readable** – Patterns should enhance, not complicate, the code.
- **Combine patterns when necessary** – Some patterns work well together, such as Factory and Singleton.
- **Follow SOLID principles** – Design patterns align well with principles like Single Responsibility and Open-Closed.
