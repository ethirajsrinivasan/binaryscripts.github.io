Handling **file uploads and media storage** efficiently is a crucial part of web applications. Ruby on Rails provides **ActiveStorage**, a built-in solution that simplifies file uploads, supports **cloud storage services**, and integrates well with image processing libraries.

In this guide, we‚Äôll cover:

‚úîÔ∏è **Setting up ActiveStorage in Rails**  
‚úîÔ∏è **Uploading and retrieving files**  
‚úîÔ∏è **Integrating cloud storage (AWS S3, Google Cloud, Azure)**  
‚úîÔ∏è **Image transformations and processing**  
‚úîÔ∏è **Optimizing performance and security**

---

#### **1. What is ActiveStorage?**
ActiveStorage is **Rails' built-in file attachment system**, introduced in **Rails 5.2**, to replace gems like **CarrierWave** and **Paperclip**.

‚úîÔ∏è Supports **local and cloud storage** (AWS S3, Google Cloud, Azure)  
‚úîÔ∏è Handles **direct file uploads** to cloud storage  
‚úîÔ∏è Provides **easy-to-use helpers** for attaching and displaying files  
‚úîÔ∏è Supports **image processing** via MiniMagick or Vips

---

#### **2. Setting Up ActiveStorage in a Rails App**
##### **Step 1: Install ActiveStorage**
Run the following command to generate ActiveStorage tables:

```sh  
rails active_storage:install  
rails db:migrate  
```

This creates tables (`active_storage_blobs`, `active_storage_attachments`) to store metadata about uploaded files.

##### **Step 2: Configure Storage Service**
Modify `config/storage.yml` to define storage services.

‚úîÔ∏è **Local Storage (default)**  
```yml  
local:  
service: Disk  
root: storage  
```

‚úîÔ∏è **Amazon S3 Storage**  
```yml  
amazon:  
service: S3  
access_key_id: <%= ENV["AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID"] %>  
secret_access_key: <%= ENV["AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"] %>  
region: us-east-1  
bucket: my-app-bucket  
```

Set the storage service in `config/environments/production.rb`:

```rb  
config.active_storage.service = :amazon  
```

---

#### **3. Attaching Files to Models**
To allow file uploads, use the `has_one_attached` or `has_many_attached` helper in models.

##### **Single File Upload Example**
```rb  
class User < ApplicationRecord  
has_one_attached :avatar  
end  
```

##### **Multiple File Upload Example**
```rb  
class Post < ApplicationRecord  
has_many_attached :images  
end  
```

---

#### **4. Uploading Files in Controllers and Forms**
##### **Updating File in Controllers**
```rb  
def update  
@user = User.find(params[:id])  
@user.avatar.attach(params[:avatar])  
redirect_to @user  
end  
```

##### **File Upload Form Example**
```erb  
<%= form_with model: @user, local: true do |form| %>  
<%= form.file_field :avatar %>  
<%= form.submit "Upload Avatar" %>  
<% end %>  
```

---

#### **5. Displaying and Processing Uploaded Files**
##### **Rendering an Image in Views**
```erb  
<%= image_tag user.avatar if user.avatar.attached? %>  
```

##### **Generating a Variant (Resizing Images)**
```erb  
<%= image_tag user.avatar.variant(resize: "100x100") %>  
```

üí° **Requires MiniMagick or Vips for image processing:**  
```sh  
gem install image_processing  
```

---

#### **6. Direct Uploads to Cloud Storage**
For large file uploads, direct cloud uploads improve **performance and scalability**.

##### **Enable Direct Uploads**
Add this to `app/javascript/packs/application.js`:

```js  
import * as ActiveStorage from "@rails/activestorage"  
ActiveStorage.start()  
```

In your form:  
```erb  
<%= form.file_field :avatar, direct_upload: true %>  
```

üöÄ This allows the browser to upload files directly to **Amazon S3, Google Cloud, or Azure**, bypassing the Rails server.

---

#### **7. Securing and Optimizing File Uploads**
##### **Restricting File Types**
```rb  
validates :avatar, content_type: ['image/png', 'image/jpeg']  
```

##### **Limiting File Size**
```rb  
validates :avatar, size: { less_than: 5.megabytes }  
```

##### **Preventing Unauthorized Downloads**
To serve files **only to authorized users**, use `redirect_to`:

```rb  
def show  
user = User.find(params[:id])  
redirect_to user.avatar.url if user.avatar.attached?  
end  
```

---

#### **8. Cleaning Up Old Files**
Unused files **take up storage** and should be deleted when an object is destroyed.

```rb  
class User < ApplicationRecord  
has_one_attached :avatar  
before_destroy :purge_avatar

def purge_avatar  
avatar.purge  
end  
end  
```

---

#### **Conclusion**
Rails **ActiveStorage** provides a **powerful and flexible** way to handle media uploads. With **cloud integration, direct uploads, and processing support**, it simplifies **file management** in Rails applications.

üöÄ **Next Steps:**  
üîπ Use ActiveStorage for **file uploads** and **image transformations**  
üîπ Integrate with **AWS S3, Google Cloud, or Azure**  
üîπ Optimize **performance and security** for media files
