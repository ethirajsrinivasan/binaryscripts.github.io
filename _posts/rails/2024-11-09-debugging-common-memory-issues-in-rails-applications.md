**Memory issues** can cripple a Ruby on Rails application, causing **slow performance, unexpected crashes, and high server costs**. Common symptoms include:

❌ Increasing **memory usage over time**  
❌ **Slow responses** due to excessive garbage collection (GC)  
❌ Frequent **Heroku or AWS memory limits exceeded errors**  
❌ **Out-of-memory (OOM) crashes** in production

In this guide, we’ll explore:  
✅ **Common memory leaks in Rails**  
✅ **How to detect memory bloat using profiling tools**  
✅ **Fixing leaks with best practices and optimizations**

---

#### **1. Understanding Memory Issues in Ruby on Rails**
Rails applications are prone to **memory bloat** due to:

🔹 **Long-lived objects** – Unreleased ActiveRecord objects, class variables, or large data structures  
🔹 **Inefficient caching** – Retaining too much data in Redis, Memcached, or Rails.cache  
🔹 **Unoptimized database queries** – Large ActiveRecord collections loaded into memory  
🔹 **Improper garbage collection (GC) settings** – Default Ruby GC may not work well for large applications

---

#### **2. Identifying Memory Leaks**
Before fixing memory issues, we need to **identify leaks** using **profiling tools**.

##### **🔍 Checking Memory Usage**
Use `ps` to monitor running Rails processes:  
```sh
ps -o pid,rss,command -p $(pgrep -f puma)
```
- `rss` (Resident Set Size) shows memory usage in KB.
- If usage keeps **increasing over time**, you might have a leak.

##### **🔍 Detecting Memory Growth with `derailed_benchmarks`**
This gem helps track memory usage:  
```sh
gem install derailed
```  
Run:  
```sh
bundle exec derailed exec perf:mem
```  
This reports **which gems are consuming the most memory**.

##### **🔍 Using `memory_profiler` for Detailed Insights**
This gem provides **line-by-line memory allocation**:  
```sh
gem install memory_profiler
```  
Run in Rails console:  
```ruby
require 'memory_profiler'
report = MemoryProfiler.report do
User.all.to_a # Example query
end
report.pretty_print
```  
Look for **objects that stay in memory longer than expected**.

##### **🔍 Monitoring Garbage Collection (GC)**
Enable GC logging to see if it's running too frequently:  
```ruby
GC::Profiler.enable
```  
Run your app and then check logs:  
```ruby
puts GC::Profiler.report
```  
If GC is **triggering too often**, your app may have **excessive object allocations**.

#### **3. Fixing Common Memory Leaks**
Once you've identified problem areas, use these techniques to **optimize memory usage**.

##### **🛠️ 1. Reduce Large ActiveRecord Queries**
Loading too much data into memory can cause bloat. Avoid:  
```ruby
users = User.all.to_a # Loads everything into memory! ❌
```  
Instead, use:  
```ruby
User.find_each(batch_size: 1000) do |user|
process(user)
end
```  
This keeps memory usage **low** by loading records in batches.

##### **🛠️ 2. Avoid Retaining Objects in Memory**
Beware of class variables storing large objects:  
```ruby
class UserCache
@@users = User.all # ❌ This stays in memory forever!
end
```  
Instead, use Rails.cache:  
```ruby
Rails.cache.fetch("users", expires_in: 10.minutes) { User.all }
```

##### **🛠️ 3. Use Explicit Object Cleanup**
If working with large data sets, explicitly free memory:  
```ruby
def process_large_data
users = User.limit(10000).to_a
users.each { |user| process(user) }
users = nil # Free memory immediately
GC.start # Trigger manual garbage collection
end
```

##### **🛠️ 4. Optimize Caching Mechanisms**
**Cache invalidation issues** can cause memory leaks if stale objects aren’t removed.  
Use **low expiration times** for cache keys:  
```ruby
Rails.cache.write("recent_users", users, expires_in: 5.minutes)
```

##### **🛠️ 5. Tune Ruby Garbage Collection**
Adjusting GC settings can **improve performance** for high-memory apps.  
Modify **`config/puma.rb`** (or Unicorn config):  
```ruby
before_fork do
GC.disable
end
after_fork do
GC.enable
GC.compact # Reduce memory fragmentation
end
```

##### **🛠️ 6. Use Jemalloc for Memory Management**
Jemalloc is a more efficient **memory allocator** than the default glibc.  
On Linux, install:  
```sh
sudo apt install libjemalloc-dev
```  
Run Rails with:  
```sh
LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libjemalloc.so rails s
```  
This **reduces memory fragmentation** and improves GC efficiency.

#### **4. Best Practices for Memory Optimization**
🔹 **Avoid long-lived objects** – Free memory where possible  
🔹 **Use database-level pagination** instead of loading all records  
🔹 **Optimize background jobs** – Avoid large in-memory jobs  
🔹 **Set caching expiration** to prevent memory bloating  
🔹 **Use profiling tools regularly** – Run memory audits in production

---

#### **Conclusion**
Memory issues can silently degrade **Rails performance** over time. By:  
✅ **Profiling memory usage regularly**  
✅ **Optimizing ActiveRecord queries**  
✅ **Configuring garbage collection efficiently**  
✅ **Using caching and background jobs effectively**

You can **prevent memory leaks**, reduce **server costs**, and improve **response times**. 🚀
