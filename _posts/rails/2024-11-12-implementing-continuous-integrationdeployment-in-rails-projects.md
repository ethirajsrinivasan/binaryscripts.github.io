excerpt: Learn how to set up a robust Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline in your Rails projects using GitHub Actions, Docker, and Capistrano.
---
**How do you ensure code quality, automate testing, and deploy Rails applications effortlessly?** ðŸš€

**CI/CD (Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment)** automates the entire **build, test, and deployment process**, reducing errors and ensuring fast, reliable releases.

In this guide, we will cover:  
âœ… **Setting up Continuous Integration (CI) with GitHub Actions**  
âœ… **Running automated tests on every push**  
âœ… **Building Docker containers for deployment**  
âœ… **Using Capistrano for zero-downtime releases**

By the end, youâ€™ll have **a fully automated pipeline** to ship high-quality Rails code faster. ðŸš€

---

#### **1. Understanding CI/CD in Rails**
##### **What is Continuous Integration (CI)?**
CI ensures **each code commit is tested automatically** before merging.

ðŸ’¡ **Example Workflow:**
1. Developer pushes code â†’ **GitHub Actions triggers**
2. **Run RSpec & RuboCop tests**
3. If tests pass, **merge to main branch**

##### **What is Continuous Deployment (CD)?**
CD automates **deploying tested code to production**.

ðŸ’¡ **Example Workflow:**
1. Code is merged â†’ **Build a Docker image**
2. Deploy to **Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean**
3. **Capistrano ensures zero-downtime deployment**

Letâ€™s set this up step by step.

---

#### **2. Setting Up Continuous Integration with GitHub Actions**
GitHub Actions automates CI for Rails projects.

##### **ðŸ“Œ Create a `.github/workflows/ci.yml` File**
```yml
name: CI

on:
push:
branches:
- main
pull_request:

jobs:
test:
runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    services:
      postgres:
        image: postgres:13
        env:
          POSTGRES_USER: postgres
          POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
        ports:
          - 5432:5432

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Ruby
        uses: ruby/setup-ruby@v1
        with:
          ruby-version: 3.1
          bundler-cache: true

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: bundle install

      - name: Set up database
        run: |
          cp config/database.yml.ci config/database.yml
          bin/rails db:create db:migrate

      - name: Run tests
        run: bundle exec rspec
```

âœ… **Triggers on every commit & PR**  
âœ… **Runs tests inside GitHubâ€™s cloud environment**  
âœ… **Uses PostgreSQL service for DB testing**

---

#### **3. Automating Deployment with Docker & Capistrano**
Once CI tests pass, we **deploy using Docker** and **Capistrano for zero downtime**.

##### **ðŸ“Œ Dockerize Your Rails App**
Create a `Dockerfile`:  
```dockerfile
FROM ruby:3.1

WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN bundle install
CMD ["rails", "server", "-b", "0.0.0.0"]
```

Build & push the image:  
```sh
docker build -t myrailsapp .
docker tag myrailsapp myrepo/myrailsapp:latest
docker push myrepo/myrailsapp:latest
```

Now, letâ€™s **automate deployment** with Capistrano.

##### **ðŸ“Œ Install Capistrano**
```sh
bundle add capistrano capistrano-rails capistrano-passenger
```

Run:  
```sh
bundle exec cap install
```

Modify `config/deploy.rb`:  
```ruby
set :application, "myrailsapp"
set :repo_url, "git@github.com:yourusername/myrailsapp.git"
set :deploy_to, "/var/www/myrailsapp"
```

Now, deploy with:  
```sh
cap production deploy
```

ðŸš€ **Your Rails app is now deployed automatically!**

---

#### **4. Automating Deployment with GitHub Actions**
Instead of manual deployment, **trigger Docker builds & Capistrano deploys automatically**.

##### **ðŸ“Œ Create a `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` File**
```yml
name: Deploy

on:
push:
branches:
- main

jobs:
deploy:
runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Log in to DockerHub
        run: echo "${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}" | docker login -u "${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}" --password-stdin

      - name: Build and push Docker image
        run: |
          docker build -t myrepo/myrailsapp:latest .
          docker push myrepo/myrailsapp:latest

      - name: Deploy with Capistrano
        run: |
          ssh deploy@myserver "cd /var/www/myrailsapp && cap production deploy"
```

ðŸ”¹ **Automatically deploys on `git push`**  
ðŸ”¹ **Ensures fresh Docker images are deployed**  
ðŸ”¹ **Uses GitHub Secrets for security**

#### **5. Best Practices for CI/CD in Rails**
âœ… **Run tests on every commit** â†’ Prevents broken code from reaching production  
âœ… **Use Docker for consistency** â†’ Eliminates "works on my machine" issues  
âœ… **Automate deployment** â†’ Avoids manual errors and downtime  
âœ… **Secure secrets** â†’ Use environment variables instead of hardcoding API keys  
âœ… **Monitor deployments** â†’ Use tools like New Relic or Datadog to track performance

---

#### **Conclusion**
With this setup, your Rails app now has:  
âœ… **Continuous Integration (CI) with GitHub Actions**  
âœ… **Automated Testing (RSpec, RuboCop, Postgres)**  
âœ… **Containerized Deployment with Docker**  
âœ… **Zero-Downtime Deployments with Capistrano**

This **streamlines development, increases reliability, and makes scaling easier**. ðŸš€
