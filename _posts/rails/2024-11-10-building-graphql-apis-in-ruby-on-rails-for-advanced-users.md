#### **Introduction**
GraphQL has revolutionized API development by offering **flexible data fetching, type safety, and declarative queries**. However, **building a GraphQL API in Ruby on Rails** comes with challenges, such as **query optimization, security, and performance bottlenecks**.

In this guide, we’ll explore:  
✅ **Advanced GraphQL implementation in Rails**  
✅ **Optimizing performance with batching and caching**  
✅ **Securing GraphQL APIs with authentication & authorization**  
✅ **Handling complex queries and avoiding N+1 problems**

By the end, you’ll be able to build **scalable, production-ready GraphQL APIs** in Rails. 🚀

---

#### **1. Setting Up GraphQL in a Rails Application**
To build a GraphQL API in Rails, we use the `graphql-ruby` gem:

##### **📌 Install GraphQL in Rails**
```sh
bundle add graphql
rails generate graphql:install
```  
This creates:
- `app/graphql` directory for schema, types, and mutations
- `GraphqlController` to handle requests

##### **📌 Define Your First GraphQL Type**
Create a **UserType** to expose user data:  
```ruby
class Types::UserType < Types::BaseObject
field :id, ID, null: false
field :name, String, null: false
field :email, String, null: false
end
```

##### **📌 Add Queries to Fetch Users**
Modify `QueryType` to fetch users:  
```ruby
class Types::QueryType < Types::BaseObject
field :users, [Types::UserType], null: false

def users
User.all
end
end
```

Now, you can fetch users with:  
```graphql
query {
users {
id
name
email
}
}
```

---

#### **2. Avoiding N+1 Queries with GraphQL**
A common GraphQL pitfall is **N+1 queries** when fetching related records.

##### **❌ Bad Example (Triggers Multiple Queries)**
```ruby
class Types::UserType < Types::BaseObject
field :posts, [Types::PostType], null: true

def posts
object.posts # Triggers N+1 query
end
end
```

##### **✅ Solution: Use `includes` to Eager Load**
```ruby
def users
User.includes(:posts).all
end
```  
This loads users **and their posts in one query**, avoiding **performance issues**.

##### **✅ Optimize Further with `batch-loader`**
The `batch-loader` gem **eliminates N+1 issues**:  
```ruby
class Types::UserType < Types::BaseObject
field :posts, [Types::PostType], null: true

def posts
BatchLoader::GraphQL.for(object.id).batch do |user_ids, loader|
Post.where(user_id: user_ids).each { |post| loader.call(post.user_id, post) }
end
end
end
```  
Now, GraphQL efficiently **batches and caches queries**.

---

#### **3. Implementing Authentication in GraphQL**
APIs need authentication to restrict access. Use **JWT with Devise**:

##### **📌 Generate JWT Authentication**
```sh
bundle add devise
rails generate devise:install
rails generate devise User
```

##### **📌 Secure GraphQL Queries with Current User**
Modify `context` to include authentication:  
```ruby
class GraphqlController < ApplicationController
before_action :authenticate_user!

def execute
context = { current_user: current_user }
result = MyAppSchema.execute(params[:query], context: context)
render json: result
end
end
```

##### **📌 Restrict Query Access**
```ruby
class Types::QueryType < Types::BaseObject
field :current_user, Types::UserType, null: true

def current_user
context[:current_user] # Only authenticated users can access
end
end
```

Now, clients must **send a valid token** to access user data.

---

#### **4. Implementing Role-Based Authorization**
Use **Pundit** for fine-grained authorization:  
```sh
bundle add pundit
```

##### **📌 Define Policies for Authorization**
```ruby
class UserPolicy < ApplicationPolicy
def update?
user.admin? || record == user
end
end
```

##### **📌 Restrict Mutations Based on Role**
```ruby
class Mutations::UpdateUser < Mutations::BaseMutation
argument :id, ID, required: true
argument :name, String, required: false

field :user, Types::UserType, null: false

def resolve(id:, name:)
user = User.find(id)
raise GraphQL::ExecutionError, "Not authorized" unless UserPolicy.new(context[:current_user], user).update?

    user.update!(name: name)
    { user: user }
end
end
```  
This ensures **only authorized users** can update profiles.

---

#### **5. Optimizing GraphQL Performance**
Large queries **slow down responses**. Use these techniques:

##### **📌 Limit Query Depth**
To prevent abusive queries, set max depth:  
```ruby
GraphQL::Schema.define do
max_depth 10
end
```

##### **📌 Use Query Complexity Analysis**
Limit expensive queries:  
```ruby
GraphQL::Schema.define do
default_max_page_size 50
max_complexity 200
end
```

##### **📌 Implement Response Caching**
Use `graphql-cache` gem to cache responses:  
```ruby
field :posts, [Types::PostType], null: true, cache: true
```

Now, **frequently requested data is served faster**.

---

#### **Conclusion**
GraphQL is **powerful**, but **performance and security** must be **carefully managed**. By:

✅ **Optimizing queries to prevent N+1 issues**  
✅ **Implementing authentication & authorization**  
✅ **Limiting query complexity and depth**  
✅ **Caching responses for better performance**

You can build a **scalable, production-ready GraphQL API** in Rails. 🚀
