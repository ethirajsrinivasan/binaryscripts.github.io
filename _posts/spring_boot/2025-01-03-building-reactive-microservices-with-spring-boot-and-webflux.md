---
As applications scale and workloads increase, traditional thread-per-request models often hit limitations. Reactive programming offers a non-blocking, event-driven alternative that makes better use of system resources under high load.

**Spring WebFlux**, introduced in Spring 5, is a reactive-stack web framework built to support non-blocking I/O. It works on top of **Project Reactor**, enabling Java developers to build **reactive microservices** that are highly scalable and efficient.

This guide walks you through the foundations of reactive programming and how to build reactive microservices using **Spring Boot** and **WebFlux**.

#### What is Reactive Programming?

Reactive programming is a paradigm focused on **asynchronous data streams** and **event-driven architecture**. Instead of blocking threads, reactive systems respond to data events as they occur.

Core principles:
- **Responsive**: Handle requests in a timely manner
- **Resilient**: Stay responsive in the face of failure
- **Elastic**: Scale to handle varying load
- **Message-driven**: Communicate asynchronously

---

#### Introducing Spring WebFlux

Spring WebFlux supports two programming models:
1. **Annotated Controllers** (like `@RestController`)
2. **Functional Endpoints** (with `RouterFunction` and `HandlerFunction`)

Unlike Spring MVC, WebFlux is built on **non-blocking runtimes** like **Netty**, making it ideal for reactive applications.

Add dependencies to `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-webflux</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

---

#### Working with Reactive Types

Spring WebFlux uses **Mono** and **Flux** from Project Reactor:

- **Mono**: 0 or 1 value
- **Flux**: 0 to many values

Examples:

```java
@GetMapping("/mono")
public Mono<String> getMono() {
return Mono.just("Hello Reactive World");
}

@GetMapping("/flux")
public Flux<Integer> getFlux() {
return Flux.range(1, 5);
}
```

These types represent non-blocking, asynchronous streams.

#### Reactive Repository with Spring Data

Spring Data R2DBC enables reactive access to relational databases.

Add dependencies:

```xml
<dependency>
<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-data-r2dbc</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
<groupId>io.r2dbc</groupId>
<artifactId>r2dbc-h2</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

Define a reactive repository:

```java
public interface UserRepository extends ReactiveCrudRepository<User, Long> {
Flux<User> findByRole(String role);
}
```

Everything from queries to saving records is non-blocking.

---

#### Functional Routing Example

Functional endpoints offer more control and are fully reactive:

```java
@Bean
public RouterFunction<ServerResponse> route(UserHandler handler) {
return RouterFunctions
.route(GET("/users"), handler::getAllUsers)
.andRoute(POST("/users"), handler::createUser);
}
```

Handler implementation:

```java
public Mono<ServerResponse> getAllUsers(ServerRequest request) {
return ServerResponse.ok().body(userRepository.findAll(), User.class);
}
```

---

#### Error Handling in WebFlux

Use `onErrorResume` or global exception handling with `@ControllerAdvice`:

```java
@GetMapping("/user/{id}")
public Mono<ResponseEntity<User>> getUser(@PathVariable Long id) {
return userRepository.findById(id)
.map(ResponseEntity::ok)
.switchIfEmpty(Mono.just(ResponseEntity.notFound().build()));
}
```

For global error handling, implement `ErrorWebExceptionHandler`.

---

#### WebClient for Reactive HTTP Calls

Replace `RestTemplate` with **WebClient** for non-blocking HTTP calls:

```java
WebClient client = WebClient.create("http://localhost:8080");

Mono<User> userMono = client.get()
.uri("/users/1")
.retrieve()
.bodyToMono(User.class);
```

WebClient integrates seamlessly with reactive flows.

---

#### Testing Reactive APIs

Use **StepVerifier** from Reactor Test to test `Mono` and `Flux`:

```java
@Test
void testMono() {
Mono<String> mono = Mono.just("Spring");

    StepVerifier.create(mono)
        .expectNext("Spring")
        .verifyComplete();
}
```

For controller tests, use `WebTestClient` to simulate HTTP requests:

```java
@Autowired
private WebTestClient webTestClient;

@Test
void testGetUsers() {
webTestClient.get()
.uri("/users")
.exchange()
.expectStatus().isOk()
.expectBodyList(User.class);
}
```

---

#### Benefits of Building Reactive Microservices

- **Better resource utilization** under high load
- Improved **throughput** with fewer threads
- Suitable for **event-driven** and **real-time** systems
- Seamless integration with **Kafka**, **MongoDB**, **R2DBC**, and more

Use cases:
- Chat systems
- Live feeds and dashboards
- API gateways and aggregators
- High-concurrency services

---

#### Best Practices

- Use reactive APIs end-to-end (database, HTTP, messaging)
- Avoid blocking calls (like JDBC, Thread.sleep)
- Use `Schedulers.boundedElastic()` for bridging non-reactive tasks
- Limit response sizes and apply backpressure mechanisms
- Monitor latency and throughput using tools like Micrometer

---

#### Conclusion

Reactive programming with Spring WebFlux enables you to build microservices that are **lightweight**, **scalable**, and **resilient under load**. By embracing `Mono`, `Flux`, and non-blocking patterns, you unlock the full power of modern Java applications built for real-time performance.

Whether you're scaling APIs or building event-driven pipelines, **Spring Boot + WebFlux** provides the ideal foundation for reactive microservice architecture.
