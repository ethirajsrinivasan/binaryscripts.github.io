Modern frontend applications require **flexible APIs** that minimize over-fetching and under-fetching. REST APIs, while powerful, often return fixed responses that may not match a client's exact data needs. This is where **GraphQL** shines.

With **Spring Boot and GraphQL**, you can design APIs where clients control the shape of the response. This results in better performance, faster development cycles, and a cleaner separation of concerns.

In this post, youâ€™ll learn how to build GraphQL APIs in Spring Boot, define schemas, create resolvers, and implement pagination, filtering, and best practices for production-ready GraphQL services.

#### Why Use GraphQL?

GraphQL is a query language for APIs developed by Facebook. It allows clients to:
- Request exactly the data they need
- Combine multiple resources in a single request
- Avoid multiple round trips

Key benefits include:
- Client-driven queries
- Strongly-typed schemas
- Built-in documentation via introspection
- Efficient bandwidth usage

#### Setting Up Spring Boot with GraphQL

Spring Boot supports GraphQL via the **spring-boot-starter-graphql** module.

Add dependencies in `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-graphql</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
<groupId>com.graphql-java</groupId>
<artifactId>graphql-java-tools</artifactId>
<version>13.0</version>
</dependency>
```

Enable GraphQL UI via:

```xml
<dependency>
<groupId>com.graphql-java-kickstart</groupId>
<artifactId>graphiql-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
<version>11.1.0</version>
</dependency>
```

Now start your Spring Boot app and access `/graphiql` to test queries.

---

#### Defining GraphQL Schemas

GraphQL uses a schema file to define types and relationships.

Create a file: `src/main/resources/graphql/schema.graphqls`

```graphql
type Query {
users: [User]
userById(id: ID!): User
}

type User {
id: ID!
name: String
email: String
}
```

This defines a `User` type and two queries: `users` and `userById`.

---

#### Implementing Resolvers in Java

Create a resolver class to provide data for your schema:

```java
@Component
public class UserQueryResolver implements GraphQLQueryResolver {

    private final UserService userService;

    public UserQueryResolver(UserService userService) {
        this.userService = userService;
    }

    public List<User> users() {
        return userService.getAllUsers();
    }

    public User userById(Long id) {
        return userService.getUserById(id);
    }
}
```

Resolvers map directly to the queries and fields in your schema.

---

#### Adding Arguments and Filtering

GraphQL allows argument-based filtering without defining new endpoints:

```graphql
type Query {
searchUsers(name: String): [User]
}
```

Implement in the resolver:

```java
public List<User> searchUsers(String name) {
return userRepository.findByNameContainingIgnoreCase(name);
}
```

This gives clients control over search functionality.

---

#### Pagination Support

For large datasets, use pagination with custom arguments:

```graphql
type Query {
usersPaginated(page: Int = 0, size: Int = 10): [User]
}
```

In the resolver:

```java
public List<User> usersPaginated(int page, int size) {
Pageable pageable = PageRequest.of(page, size);
return userRepository.findAll(pageable).getContent();
}
```

Alternatively, implement cursor-based pagination for better performance.

---

#### Nested Queries and Relationships

GraphQL shines with nested and relational data:

```graphql
type Post {
id: ID!
title: String
author: User
}

type User {
id: ID!
name: String
posts: [Post]
}
```

Resolvers can fetch related data dynamically, avoiding over-fetching.

---

#### Error Handling

Throw application-level exceptions in resolvers and handle them globally:

```java
@Component
public class GraphQLExceptionHandler extends DataFetcherExceptionResolverAdapter {
@Override
protected GraphQLError resolveToSingleError(Throwable ex, DataFetchingEnvironment env) {
return GraphqlErrorBuilder.newError(env)
.message(ex.getMessage())
.build();
}
}
```

Use `GraphQLError` objects to return structured error messages.

#### GraphQL vs REST

| Feature         | GraphQL               | REST                    |
|-----------------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| Flexibility     | High (client-driven)   | Low (server-defined)     |
| Overfetching    | Avoided                | Common                   |
| Tooling         | Schema-first, typed    | Often ad hoc             |
| Documentation   | Built-in introspection | Swagger/OpenAPI          |

Use GraphQL when your clients need dynamic control or multiple related datasets in one call.

---

#### Best Practices

- Use DTOs to decouple internal models from schema
- Avoid N+1 query problems with batching tools like **DataLoader**
- Secure queries with depth limiting and whitelisting
- Document schema evolution strategies for backward compatibility
- Expose health endpoints for GraphQL uptime monitoring

---

#### Conclusion

**Spring Boot and GraphQL** make it easy to build APIs that are both developer-friendly and performance-efficient. With a flexible schema, powerful resolver model, and seamless integration with existing Spring services, GraphQL is a great choice for building modern backend services.

By mastering Spring Boot + GraphQL, you unlock a more **client-focused, scalable, and elegant** way to expose data to frontend applications.
