In a microservices architecture, client requests are typically routed through an **API Gateway**. This central component provides a unified entry point to all backend services, handling responsibilities like **routing**, **security**, **rate limiting**, **logging**, and **load balancing**.

**Spring Cloud Gateway**, built on top of Spring Boot and Project Reactor, offers a powerful, non-blocking API gateway framework that’s easy to integrate into existing Java systems.

In this guide, you’ll learn how to implement an API Gateway using **Spring Boot** and **Spring Cloud Gateway**, enabling efficient communication and control across your microservices.

#### What Is an API Gateway?

An API Gateway serves as a **reverse proxy** that routes client requests to the appropriate service. It abstracts service endpoints and enforces cross-cutting concerns such as:

- Routing and path rewriting
- Authentication and authorization
- CORS and headers
- Request throttling
- Circuit breaking and fallback

#### Adding Spring Cloud Gateway to Your Project

Include the dependency in your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
<groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
<artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-gateway</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

Add the Spring Cloud BOM to manage versions:

```xml
<dependencyManagement>
<dependencies>
<dependency>
<groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
<artifactId>spring-cloud-dependencies</artifactId>
<version>2023.0.0</version>
<type>pom</type>
<scope>import</scope>
</dependency>
</dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
```

#### Defining Routes in application.yml

Configure routes to different services:

```yml
spring:
cloud:
gateway:
routes:
- id: user-service
uri: http://localhost:8081
predicates:
- Path=/api/users/**
filters:
- StripPrefix=2

        - id: order-service
          uri: http://localhost:8082
          predicates:
            - Path=/api/orders/**
          filters:
            - StripPrefix=2
```

This maps `/api/users/**` to the user service and removes the `/api` prefix.

---

#### Adding Custom Filters

You can implement global or route-specific filters for logging, authorization, etc.

Example: A custom filter to log request paths

```java
@Component
public class LoggingFilter implements GlobalFilter {

    @Override
    public Mono<Void> filter(ServerWebExchange exchange, GatewayFilterChain chain) {
        System.out.println("Request Path: " + exchange.getRequest().getPath());
        return chain.filter(exchange);
    }
}
```

---

#### Rate Limiting and Throttling

Add Redis and enable rate limiting:

```yml
spring:
cloud:
gateway:
routes:
- id: product-service
uri: http://localhost:8083
predicates:
- Path=/api/products/**
filters:
- name: RequestRateLimiter
args:
redis-rate-limiter.replenishRate: 10
redis-rate-limiter.burstCapacity: 20
```

You’ll need Redis running and include the `spring-cloud-starter-redis` dependency.

---

#### Securing the Gateway

Integrate with Spring Security and JWT to authenticate requests.

Add the dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-oauth2-resource-server</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

Configure JWT validation:

```yml
spring:
security:
oauth2:
resourceserver:
jwt:
issuer-uri: https://auth.myapp.com
```

Secure routes with `SecurityWebFilterChain`:

```java
@Bean
public SecurityWebFilterChain securityFilterChain(ServerHttpSecurity http) {
return http
.authorizeExchange(ex -> ex
.pathMatchers("/api/public/**").permitAll()
.anyExchange().authenticated()
)
.oauth2ResourceServer().jwt()
.and().build();
}
```

---

#### Load Balancing with Service Discovery

Use Spring Cloud Discovery (e.g., with Eureka or Consul) to resolve service URIs dynamically.

```xml
<dependency>
<groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
<artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-client</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

Enable load-balanced routing:

```yml
spring:
cloud:
gateway:
discovery:
locator:
enabled: true
lowerCaseServiceId: true
```

Then reference services by name:

```yml
routes:
- id: inventory
  uri: lb://inventory-service
  predicates:
  - Path=/api/inventory/**
    ```

---

#### Adding Circuit Breakers with Resilience4j

Protect services with timeouts and fallback handlers:

```yml
filters:
- name: CircuitBreaker
  args:
  name: inventoryCB
  fallbackUri: forward:/fallback/inventory
  ```

Create a fallback controller:

```java
@RestController
public class FallbackController {
@GetMapping("/fallback/inventory")
public Mono<String> fallback() {
return Mono.just("Inventory service is temporarily unavailable");
}
}
```

---

#### CORS Configuration

Handle cross-origin requests in `application.yml`:

```yml
spring:
cloud:
gateway:
globalcors:
corsConfigurations:
'[/**]':
allowedOrigins: "*"
allowedMethods: "*"
```

Or create a custom `CorsConfigurationSource`.

---

#### Monitoring Gateway Traffic

Use Micrometer with Prometheus and Grafana to track:
- Request rates
- Response status codes
- Latency per route

Add:

```xml
<dependency>
<groupId>io.micrometer</groupId>
<artifactId>micrometer-registry-prometheus</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

Expose actuator metrics:

```yml
management:
endpoints:
web:
exposure:
include: prometheus,health,info
```

---

#### Conclusion

A well-designed **API Gateway** is essential in any modern microservices architecture. With **Spring Cloud Gateway**, you can build a powerful and reactive API management layer that handles routing, security, load balancing, and resilience — all within the Spring Boot ecosystem.

By applying these patterns and best practices, your architecture becomes more maintainable, secure, and ready for scale.
