Transaction management is a core aspect of building **robust and consistent** Java applications, especially when dealing with databases. While Spring Boot makes it easy to annotate methods with `@Transactional`, mastering **advanced transaction techniques** gives you precise control over **consistency**, **concurrency**, and **failure recovery**.

In this guide, we'll explore advanced transactional behaviors in Spring Boot, covering:
- Propagation types
- Isolation levels
- Nested transactions
- Rollback control
- AOP-based transaction boundaries
- Common pitfalls and best practices

#### Basics of @Transactional in Spring

Spring’s `@Transactional` annotation defines the transactional scope of a method. When applied to a method, it wraps the logic in a database transaction.

```java
@Transactional
public void createOrder(Order order) {
orderRepository.save(order);
}
```

By default:
- If an unchecked exception occurs (RuntimeException), the transaction is rolled back
- Checked exceptions do not trigger rollback unless explicitly specified

---

#### Propagation Strategies Explained

Propagation defines how a transactional method should behave if a transaction already exists.

Spring offers several propagation options:

- **REQUIRED** (default): Join existing or start a new transaction
- **REQUIRES_NEW**: Always start a new transaction, suspending the current one
- **NESTED**: Execute within a nested transaction if a current one exists
- **NOT_SUPPORTED**: Run non-transactionally
- **NEVER**: Fails if a transaction exists

Example:

```java
@Transactional(propagation = Propagation.REQUIRES_NEW)
public void logAudit(AuditLog log) {
auditRepository.save(log);
}
```

Useful for logging, auditing, or saving errors even if the parent transaction fails.

---

#### Nested Transactions and Savepoints

NESTED propagation uses **savepoints** within the existing transaction. You can roll back just the nested section without affecting the outer transaction.

```java
@Transactional(propagation = Propagation.NESTED)
public void saveChildData() {
// If this fails, outer transaction can still commit
}
```

⚠️ Note: NESTED requires a database and JDBC driver that supports savepoints (e.g., PostgreSQL, Oracle). JPA may not support nested transactions depending on the vendor.

---

#### Isolation Levels for Concurrency Control

Isolation levels determine how transactions interact with each other in terms of visibility:

- **READ_UNCOMMITTED**: See uncommitted changes (dirty read)
- **READ_COMMITTED**: Only committed data is visible (default in most databases)
- **REPEATABLE_READ**: Prevents non-repeatable reads
- **SERIALIZABLE**: Strictest level, prevents phantom reads

Set it via annotation:

```java
@Transactional(isolation = Isolation.SERIALIZABLE)
public void processCriticalTransaction() {
// maximum data safety
}
```

Choose based on the level of data consistency your use case requires.

---

#### Custom Rollback Rules

By default, Spring only rolls back on unchecked exceptions. To rollback on specific exceptions:

```java
@Transactional(rollbackFor = { SQLException.class, CustomCheckedException.class })
public void riskyOperation() throws CustomCheckedException {
// will rollback on checked exception
}
```

You can also use `noRollbackFor` to allow commits even after certain exceptions.

---

#### Transactional AOP and Method Visibility

Spring AOP proxies are responsible for applying transactional behavior. Therefore:
- Only **public methods** are advised by default
- **Internal method calls** within the same bean bypass the proxy and lose `@Transactional` behavior

Workaround: Extract transactional logic into separate service classes or use **AspectJ weaving**.

Bad (internal call, no transaction):
```java
public void doMain() {
this.doTransactional(); // no transaction here
}

@Transactional
public void doTransactional() {
// no effect
}
```

Good (called via proxy):
```java
@Service
public class TransactionalHelper {
@Transactional
public void doTransactional() {
// works
}
}
```

---

#### Chained Transactions and Exception Propagation

Be cautious when chaining transactional methods:

```java
@Transactional
public void outer() {
try {
inner(); // marked as REQUIRES_NEW
} catch (Exception e) {
// catch and suppress
}
// will still commit outer even if inner failed
}
```

To maintain consistency, log, and rethrow critical exceptions or coordinate commits manually using propagation flags.

---

#### Transaction Events and Listeners

Listen to transactional events with Spring’s `TransactionSynchronizationManager`:

```java
TransactionSynchronizationManager.registerSynchronization(new TransactionSynchronizationAdapter() {
@Override
public void afterCommit() {
// trigger email or notification
}
});
```

You can use `@TransactionalEventListener` for domain-driven designs.

---

#### Best Practices

- Use `@Transactional` on service methods, not repositories
- Avoid long-running transactions
- Handle exceptions carefully; don’t suppress unintentionally
- Log transaction boundaries for debugging
- Profile and tune isolation levels per use case
- Validate NESTED and REQUIRES_NEW behavior with your DB engine

---

#### Conclusion

Transaction management in Spring Boot goes far beyond simple annotations. By mastering **propagation behaviors**, **isolation levels**, **nested transactions**, and **rollback rules**, you can build applications that are **consistent, resilient, and ready for complex business logic**.

Whether you’re working with microservices, monoliths, or event-driven systems, fine-grained transactional control is essential to maintaining data integrity and application reliability.
