Apache Spark is powerful — until it’s not. Performance issues can sneak in through skewed joins, improper caching, shuffles, and memory pressure. The good news? You can uncover *most* of these problems **without logs or third-party tools**. All you need is the **Spark UI**.

This post gives you a **battle-tested checklist** of what to look for and the **red flags** that scream “optimize me.” Bookmark it. You’ll need it.

#### ✅ Jobs Tab — First Glance, Big Picture

- **What to check**:
  - Jobs sorted by duration
  - Failed or retried jobs
  - Number of stages per job

- **Red flags**:
  - Long job durations (especially after retries)
  - High failure/retry count
  - Jobs with uneven stage durations

- **Why it matters**:
  - This tab helps narrow your investigation to the most expensive parts of your pipeline.

---

#### ✅ Stages Tab — Stage-level Heat Zones

- **What to check**:
  - Stage duration (sort descending)
  - Shuffle Read/Write volume
  - GC Time per stage
  - Input/output records
  - Task duration variance

- **Red flags**:
  - A single stage dominating runtime
  - High shuffle read/write (GBs instead of MBs)
  - GC Time > 10% of stage duration
  - Tasks with large duration variance = **data skew**

- **Why it matters**:
  - Most Spark performance problems surface at the stage level — especially wide transformations like `groupBy`, `join`, and `distinct`.

---

#### ✅ Tasks Tab — Microscope Mode

- **What to check**:
  - Distribution of task durations
  - Failed tasks
  - Input/output bytes
  - Spill data
  - Task locality (NODE_LOCAL, PROCESS_LOCAL, ANY)

- **Red flags**:
  - A few tasks take *much longer* than the rest
  - Spill (memory or disk) present in most tasks
  - Uneven I/O = **bad partitioning or skew**
  - Tasks consistently running as `ANY` → *locality delay*

- **Why it matters**:
  - This is where you catch anomalies like stragglers and poorly distributed workloads.

---

#### ✅ Executors Tab — Cluster Health Pulse

- **What to check**:
  - GC Time %
  - Task and input distribution
  - Shuffle read/write volume per executor
  - Failed tasks
  - Memory and storage usage

- **Red flags**:
  - High GC Time (esp. >20%)
  - One executor doing more work than others = **imbalanced partitions**
  - Memory usage close to max (with spill) = **consider tuning executor memory**
  - Repeated task failures → hardware issues or bad code

- **Why it matters**:
  - Executor imbalance, memory pressure, and garbage collection can tank performance silently.

---

#### ✅ SQL Tab — Plan or Pain?

- **What to check**:
  - Query duration
  - Join strategies used (`SortMergeJoin` vs `BroadcastHashJoin`)
  - Scan size and output rows
  - Partition pruning effectiveness
  - Physical plan hierarchy

- **Red flags**:
  - Full table scans without filters
  - Small dimension tables not being broadcasted
  - Lots of `SortMergeJoin` where `BroadcastJoin` could be used
  - Missing partition filters (check your `WHERE` clause)

- **Why it matters**:
  - Optimizing Spark SQL often brings the **biggest wins**. Poor query planning is a hidden cost center.

---

#### ✅ Storage Tab — Caching Gone Wrong

- **What to check**:
  - Cached RDD/DataFrame size
  - Memory used vs memory cached
  - Fraction cached
  - Recomputations after actions

- **Red flags**:
  - RDDs cached but not materialized
  - Low memory fraction cached = **wasteful caching**
  - Frequent recomputation = **improper persistence strategy**

- **Why it matters**:
  - Caching is only helpful if it’s used *right*. Otherwise, it just eats memory.

---

#### ✅ Environment & Config Tabs — Sanity Checks

- **What to check**:
  - Spark version
  - Configurations like:
    - `spark.sql.shuffle.partitions`
    - `spark.executor.memory`
    - `spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold`
    - `spark.dynamicAllocation.enabled`

- **Red flags**:
  - Default partition count (e.g., 200) for huge datasets
  - Broadcast join thresholds too low
  - Dynamic allocation turned off without reasoning

- **Why it matters**:
  - Misconfigurations at this level cascade into all the tabs above.

---

#### Pro Tips

- Use the **timeline view** in the Stages tab for quick visual detection of stragglers.
- Combine SQL plan info with stage/task data to correlate slow queries with compute overhead.
- Bookmark long-running job links to compare pre- and post-optimization.

#### Conclusion

Debugging Spark performance isn’t a black box. The Spark UI gives you all the visibility you need — if you know where to look.

Next time your pipeline misbehaves, skip the logs and dashboards. Open the Spark UI, walk this checklist, and tackle bottlenecks with confidence.

✨ *One UI to find them all. One checklist to debug them.* ✨
