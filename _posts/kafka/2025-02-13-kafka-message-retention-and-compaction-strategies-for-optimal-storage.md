Apache Kafka is known for its high-throughput, fault-tolerant publish-subscribe model. A critical part of Kafka’s efficiency lies in how it manages message **retention and storage**. Kafka supports both **time-based retention** and **log compaction**, allowing developers to balance between **durability**, **storage cost**, and **real-time accessibility**.

In this post, we’ll explore Kafka’s **message retention and compaction strategies**, explain how they work, and share best practices for optimizing Kafka storage in production.

#### Kafka’s Storage Model

Kafka stores messages in **logs**, segmented by partitions. Each topic-partition is backed by an append-only log that grows over time.

Kafka brokers periodically:
- Segment logs
- Delete or compact older messages
- Retain logs based on topic-level configurations

You can control how long and how much Kafka retains by tuning **retention settings** and enabling **log compaction** where appropriate.

---

#### Message Retention Policies

Kafka supports **time-based** and **size-based** retention.

Set via topic configurations:

```properties
retention.ms=604800000  # 7 days
retention.bytes=1073741824  # 1GB per partition
```

| Setting        | Description                           |
|----------------|----------------------------------------|
| `retention.ms` | Retain messages for X milliseconds     |
| `retention.bytes` | Retain messages until X bytes of log size |

Once a segment falls outside of these limits, it is **deleted** by the broker.

---

#### Log Compaction

Log compaction ensures Kafka retains the **latest value for each key**, enabling:
- Efficient **change data capture (CDC)**
- **Cache updates** and state reconstruction
- Durable **last-known-good-value** messages

Enable it per topic:

```properties
cleanup.policy=compact
```

Kafka then:
- Retains at least the latest message per key
- Discards older entries with the same key
- Keeps tombstone messages (null values) for delete tracking

---

#### Combined Policies: Delete + Compact

Kafka supports **hybrid retention**:

```properties
cleanup.policy=compact,delete
```

Use this when:
- You want to preserve **latest state per key**
- But still want to **delete segments** beyond a time threshold

This is helpful for topics where some state tracking is needed but full logs aren’t required long-term.

---

#### Example: Compacted vs. Non-Compacted Topics

**Non-Compacted (default)**
- Every message is retained for a configured time or size.
- Use for analytics, auditing, reprocessing.

**Compacted**
- Only the latest message for each key is kept.
- Use for change logs, lookup state, and system events.

---

#### Tombstone Messages and Deletes

To delete a key from a compacted topic, produce a **null value**:

```json
{"key": "user123", "value": null}
```

Kafka retains this tombstone for `delete.retention.ms`, after which it's removed during compaction.

---

#### Best Practices

1. **Segment Your Topics**  
   Use separate topics for:
  - Full logs
  - Compacted change logs
  - Retained snapshots

2. **Tune Segment Sizes and Timeouts**  
   Lower segment size → faster cleanup  
   Higher segment.ms → fewer files, better compaction performance

3. **Monitor Disk Usage**  
   Use `kafka-log-dirs.sh` or Prometheus JMX exporters

4. **Test Compaction with Staging Topics**  
   Validate that your compaction logic retains exactly what’s expected

5. **Keep a Healthy Cleanup Schedule**  
   Avoid over-retention: stale data increases disk pressure and recovery time

---

#### Monitoring Retention and Compaction

Key metrics to monitor:
- `LogEndOffset` and `HighWatermark` (per partition)
- Disk usage per topic/partition
- `LogSegmentsPerPartition`
- Compaction lag (`LogCleanerManager` stats)

Use tools like:
- **Kafka Manager**
- **Prometheus + Grafana**
- **Confluent Control Center**

---

#### Conclusion

Efficient Kafka storage management starts with the **right retention and compaction strategy**. By understanding how Kafka retains and removes data, you can:
- Save disk space
- Improve recovery time
- Support real-time and replayable consumers

Whether you're building a **CDC pipeline**, a **real-time analytics stream**, or a **state sync layer**, Kafka gives you the flexibility to tune storage exactly how your architecture needs it.
