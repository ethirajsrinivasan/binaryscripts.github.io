In microservices architecture, data is often scattered across isolated, polyglot databases. Keeping these services in sync without tightly coupling them can be challenging. **Change Data Capture (CDC)** is a technique that captures changes in databases (insert, update, delete) and streams them in real-time — enabling **event-driven microservices** and **reactive data flows**.

By integrating **CDC with Apache Kafka**, teams can ensure **real-time, decoupled, and scalable** data propagation between services and systems. In this post, we explore how to implement CDC using Kafka and best practices for microservices data integration.

#### What is Change Data Capture (CDC)?

**CDC** is the process of detecting and capturing changes made to a database, and making that change available to other systems in real-time.

CDC enables:
- **Event-driven microservices** that react to DB changes
- **Audit logs** for compliance
- **ETL pipelines** for analytics and data lakes
- **Database replication** and backup

---

#### Why Kafka for CDC?

Apache Kafka is ideal for CDC due to:
- High throughput and durability
- Built-in support for partitioning and ordering
- Native integration with tools like **Debezium**
- Fault-tolerant and replayable event logs

Kafka turns change events into **immutable streams** that can be consumed asynchronously by multiple services.

#### CDC Architecture with Kafka and Debezium

```
+-------------+          +------------------+          +----------------------+
|  MySQL/Postgres/etc  | → |  Debezium Source | → Kafka | Microservices (Sinks) |
+-------------+          +------------------+          +----------------------+
```

- **Debezium** captures database changes using DB logs (binlog, WAL, redo)
- **Kafka Connect** acts as a bridge between Debezium and Kafka
- **Kafka Topics** store changes per table or event type
- **Microservices** consume topics to react or update their local state

---

#### Setting Up CDC with Kafka + Debezium

1. **Start Kafka and Kafka Connect**

Use Docker or Helm to deploy Kafka and Kafka Connect.

2. **Configure Debezium Source Connector**

Example: Capture changes from MySQL

```json
{
"name": "mysql-cdc-connector",
"config": {
"connector.class": "io.debezium.connector.mysql.MySqlConnector",
"database.hostname": "mysql-db",
"database.port": "3306",
"database.user": "cdcuser",
"database.password": "cdcpass",
"database.server.id": "12345",
"database.server.name": "inventory",
"database.include.list": "inventory",
"table.include.list": "inventory.orders",
"database.history.kafka.bootstrap.servers": "kafka:9092",
"database.history.kafka.topic": "schema-changes.inventory"
}
}
```

Submit with:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data @cdc-config.json \
http://localhost:8083/connectors
```

3. **Consume CDC Events in Microservices**

Messages are published to Kafka like:

```json
{
"before": {"id": 1, "status": "pending"},
"after": {"id": 1, "status": "shipped"},
"source": {...},
"op": "u",  // u = update, c = create, d = delete
"ts_ms": 1683560000
}
```

Services parse these changes and trigger actions accordingly.

---

#### Common Patterns in Microservices

- **Outbox Pattern**: Service writes events to a separate table; CDC publishes those rows to Kafka.
- **Dual Writes**: Avoid writing to DB and Kafka separately; use transactional outbox instead.
- **Local Materialized Views**: Services consume change streams to maintain local read-optimized replicas.

---

#### Handling Schema Changes

Debezium supports **Schema Registry** and **Avro/JSON converters**.

Enable:

```properties
value.converter=io.confluent.connect.avro.AvroConverter
value.converter.schema.registry.url=http://schema-registry:8081
```

This ensures producers and consumers share schema compatibility.

---

#### Best Practices

- Use **partitioning keys** aligned with service ownership
- Maintain **idempotent consumers** to handle retries gracefully
- Use **dead letter queues (DLQs)** for failed messages
- Monitor **lag and topic growth** with Prometheus/Grafana
- Secure the pipeline with **SASL/TLS** and **RBAC**

---

#### Monitoring CDC Pipelines

- Use Debezium’s metrics (`/metrics`) for lag, error counts
- Monitor Kafka Connect REST APIs (`/connectors`, `/status`)
- Alert on lag in consumer groups and under-replicated partitions
- Log and audit **op types (c/u/d)** for change tracking

---

#### Conclusion

By integrating **Kafka with CDC**, microservices can achieve real-time data sync without tight coupling. Tools like Debezium make it easy to capture changes and stream them into Kafka, where they can be consumed, audited, and acted upon in a scalable, fault-tolerant way.

With the right architecture and practices, **Kafka-powered CDC** can supercharge your microservices ecosystem with **event-driven data movement**, enhanced reliability, and increased agility.
