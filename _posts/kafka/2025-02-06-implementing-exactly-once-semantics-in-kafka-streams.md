In distributed stream processing, ensuring **data correctness and consistency** is crucial — especially when dealing with financial systems, inventory tracking, or critical business logic. Without proper handling, duplicate processing or message loss can lead to **incorrect results** or **state corruption**.

**Kafka Streams**, a client library for building event-driven microservices, offers **Exactly-Once Semantics (EOS)** to guarantee **each message is processed once and only once**, even in the face of failures.

In this post, we’ll explore how **Exactly-Once Semantics** works in Kafka Streams and how to configure and implement it correctly.

---
Kafka provides three delivery guarantees:

- **At-most-once**: Messages may be lost but never duplicated
- **At-least-once**: Messages are not lost but may be processed multiple times
- **Exactly-once**: No message is lost or processed more than once

EOS ensures that **produced output reflects each input message only once**, even after retries or crashes.

#### Key EOS Concepts in Kafka Streams

1. **Idempotent Producers**  
   Prevents duplicate records during producer retries by assigning sequence numbers to messages.

2. **Transactions**  
   Allows atomic writes of records to multiple Kafka topics, including changelogs and output topics.

3. **Stateful Operators**  
   Kafka Streams maintains local state (e.g., for joins, aggregations) that needs to be committed consistently.

4. **Processing Guarantees Configurations**

```java
StreamsConfig.PROCESSING_GUARANTEE_CONFIG = "exactly_once_v2"
```

Kafka 2.5+ recommends `"exactly_once_v2"` for better scalability and performance.

#### Basic Kafka Streams Configuration for EOS

```java
Properties props = new Properties();
props.put(StreamsConfig.APPLICATION_ID_CONFIG, "eos-stream-app");
props.put(StreamsConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG, "broker1:9092");
props.put(StreamsConfig.PROCESSING_GUARANTEE_CONFIG, StreamsConfig.EXACTLY_ONCE_V2);
props.put(StreamsConfig.REPLICATION_FACTOR_CONFIG, 3); // for fault-tolerant changelogs
props.put(StreamsConfig.CACHE_MAX_BYTES_BUFFERING_CONFIG, 0); // optional for deterministic output
props.put(StreamsConfig.DEFAULT_KEY_SERDE_CLASS_CONFIG, Serdes.String().getClass());
props.put(StreamsConfig.DEFAULT_VALUE_SERDE_CLASS_CONFIG, Serdes.String().getClass());
```

This configuration enables:
- Transactional producer/consumer
- Atomic state updates
- Deduplication and retry safety

---

#### Example: Aggregation with EOS Enabled

```java
StreamsBuilder builder = new StreamsBuilder();

KStream<String, String> input = builder.stream("input-topic");

input
.groupByKey()
.windowedBy(TimeWindows.ofSizeWithNoGrace(Duration.ofMinutes(5)))
.count()
.toStream()
.map((windowedKey, count) -> KeyValue.pair(windowedKey.key(), count.toString()))
.to("output-topic", Produced.with(Serdes.String(), Serdes.String()));
```

Even under failure, Kafka Streams guarantees:
- Each input record affects the output once
- State changelog and output topic are **committed in a single transaction**

---

#### Monitoring and Troubleshooting

Use metrics to verify EOS effectiveness:

- `commit-latency-avg`
- `eos-enabled` (should be true)
- `task.failed` or `producer.error.count`

Common misconfigurations:
- Using **non-transactional sinks** (e.g., writing to DBs without idempotency)
- Incompatible **external side effects** (use connectors with transactional support)
- **Low replication** of changelogs leading to data loss

---

#### Best Practices

- Always use **EXACTLY_ONCE_V2** in new applications (introduced in Kafka 2.5+)
- Set a **replication factor ≥ 3** for durability
- Keep **processing idempotent** where possible
- Avoid using **manual commits** — Kafka Streams handles commits atomically
- Regularly test **failure scenarios** to validate end-to-end EOS guarantees

---

#### Conclusion

Kafka Streams makes it practical to implement **exactly-once semantics** in production-grade streaming applications without adding external complexity. With proper configuration and a transactional mindset, you can build **fault-tolerant, consistent, and high-performance pipelines** that handle both operational failures and business-critical logic.

EOS is no longer just a theoretical goal — it’s a practical foundation for modern, **reliable event-driven systems**.
