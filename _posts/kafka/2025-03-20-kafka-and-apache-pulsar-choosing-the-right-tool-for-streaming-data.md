excerpt: Apache Kafka and Apache Pulsar are two leading technologies for real-time data streaming. This post compares their architectures, features, and performance to help you select the right tool for your streaming use case.
---
As organizations move toward **event-driven architectures** and real-time data processing, choosing the right **streaming platform** becomes critical. **Apache Kafka** and **Apache Pulsar** are two of the most popular open-source messaging systems, each offering powerful features for building scalable, reliable data pipelines.

In this post, we’ll compare **Kafka and Pulsar** across architecture, performance, scalability, and ecosystem to help you make an informed decision for your streaming workloads.

#### Kafka Overview

**Apache Kafka** is a distributed event streaming platform originally developed by LinkedIn. It is designed for **high-throughput**, **fault-tolerant**, and **durable messaging**.

Key features:
- Append-only logs with partition-based storage
- High-performance streaming via Kafka Streams
- Strong ecosystem: Kafka Connect, ksqlDB, Confluent Platform
- Persistent, replayable messaging model

Kafka is widely adopted in large-scale data processing, log aggregation, and analytics pipelines.

#### Pulsar Overview

**Apache Pulsar** is a cloud-native, distributed pub-sub system originally developed by Yahoo. It is designed with **multi-tenancy**, **geo-replication**, and **streaming + queuing** support built in.

Key features:
- Decoupled storage and compute using Apache BookKeeper
- True multi-tenant support with namespaces
- Serverless functions (Pulsar Functions)
- Topic compaction and dead-letter queues (DLQs)

Pulsar is gaining popularity for **hybrid cloud** use cases and **event-driven microservices**.

#### Architectural Comparison

| Feature              | Kafka                               | Pulsar                                  |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Storage              | Coupled with brokers (monolithic)   | Decoupled via BookKeeper                |
| Multi-tenancy        | Limited                             | Native (namespaces, isolation)          |
| Geo-replication      | External tools (e.g., MirrorMaker)  | Built-in                                |
| Message model        | Publish-subscribe                   | Pub-sub + queue                          |
| Serverless functions | No                                  | Yes (Pulsar Functions)                  |
| Message retention    | Time/size-based                     | Time/size + compaction                   |

**Pulsar’s architecture** offers better isolation and flexibility, while **Kafka’s model** is more mature and simpler for many common use cases.

#### Performance and Scalability

- **Kafka** scales by adding brokers and partitions. Performance can degrade with a very high number of partitions.
- **Pulsar** scales more granularly with separate storage and serving layers, leading to better elasticity in some environments.

**Pulsar excels** in scenarios with many small topics or partitions, while **Kafka performs well** with larger batch processing and fewer partitions per topic.

#### Ecosystem and Tooling

| Tooling/Feature     | Kafka                                | Pulsar                                 |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Stream processing   | Kafka Streams, ksqlDB                | Pulsar Functions, Flink, Spark          |
| Connectors          | Kafka Connect (large ecosystem)      | Pulsar IO (growing library)             |
| Monitoring          | JMX, Confluent Control Center        | Prometheus, Pulsar Dashboard            |
| Schema registry     | Confluent Schema Registry            | Built-in                                |
| Language support    | Java, Python, Go, Node.js, .NET      | Java, Python, Go, C++, Node.js          |

Kafka has a more mature and extensive **ecosystem**, especially for **stream processing**. Pulsar’s **multi-language support** and **serverless compute** make it attractive for microservice-based systems.

#### When to Use Kafka

Choose **Apache Kafka** when:
- You need **high-throughput** and simple event streaming
- You're already using the **Confluent ecosystem**
- Your team is experienced with Kafka and its APIs
- You want **stream processing** capabilities (Kafka Streams, ksqlDB)

---

#### When to Use Pulsar

Choose **Apache Pulsar** when:
- You need **multi-tenancy**, **geo-replication**, or **multi-region architecture**
- You need **both queue and stream** semantics
- You prefer **decoupled storage and compute**
- You want to build **serverless apps** with **Pulsar Functions**

#### Conclusion

Both **Apache Kafka** and **Apache Pulsar** are excellent choices for real-time data streaming, but their strengths vary depending on the use case.

- Choose **Kafka** for mature pipelines, large-scale stream processing, and when ecosystem integration is key.
- Choose **Pulsar** when you need **multi-tenancy**, **geo-distribution**, or **event queueing** alongside streaming.

Ultimately, the best choice depends on your architectural goals, scalability needs, and operational constraints.
