Modern web applications often need to process long-running tasks, such as sending emails, processing files, or handling complex computations. **Flask**, being a lightweight framework, is not designed for background task execution. This is where **Celery** comes inâ€”a **powerful distributed task queue** that allows Flask applications to process tasks asynchronously.

In this blog, we will explore **how to integrate Celery with Flask**, optimize task execution, and improve performance using **Redis** as a message broker.

## Setting Up Flask and Celery

### Installing Dependencies

To get started, install Flask, Celery, and Redis using **pip**:

```sh
pip install flask celery redis
```

Ensure that **Redis** is installed and running:

```sh
redis-server
```

### Configuring Celery in Flask

Create a **Flask application** and configure Celery with Redis as the broker:

```python
from flask import Flask
from celery import Celery

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['CELERY_BROKER_URL'] = 'redis://localhost:6379/0'
app.config['CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND'] = 'redis://localhost:6379/0'

celery = Celery(app.name, broker=app.config['CELERY_BROKER_URL'])
celery.conf.update(app.config)
```

Now, **Celery** is ready to handle background tasks.

## Defining and Executing Celery Tasks

### Creating an Asynchronous Task

Define a sample **Celery task** inside your Flask app:

```python
@celery.task
def long_running_task(n):
import time
time.sleep(n)
return f"Task completed in {n} seconds"
```

This function **simulates a long-running task** that executes asynchronously.

### Triggering Tasks from Flask

Modify your Flask app to trigger **Celery tasks**:

```python
from flask import request, jsonify

@app.route('/run-task', methods=['POST'])
def run_task():
data = request.get_json()
task = long_running_task.apply_async(args=[data.get('duration', 5)])
return jsonify({"task_id": task.id, "status": "Task started"}), 202
```

### Running Celery Worker

Start a **Celery worker** to process tasks in the background:

```sh
celery -A app.celery worker --loglevel=info
```

Once the worker is running, **Celery will handle the background tasks** asynchronously.

## Monitoring Task Status

### Checking Task Results

Use Flask to **retrieve task results** using Celeryâ€™s task ID:

```python
@app.route('/task-status/<task_id>', methods=['GET'])
def task_status(task_id):
task = long_running_task.AsyncResult(task_id)
return jsonify({"task_id": task_id, "status": task.state, "result": task.result})
```

## Scaling Celery with Multiple Workers

### Running Multiple Workers

To **scale task execution**, run multiple Celery workers:

```sh
celery -A app.celery worker --concurrency=4 --loglevel=info
```

This allows Celery to **process multiple tasks concurrently**, improving performance.

## Conclusion

Integrating **Celery with Flask** provides an efficient way to **handle long-running operations asynchronously**. By leveraging **Redis as a message broker**, applications can scale seamlessly and handle background jobs efficiently.
