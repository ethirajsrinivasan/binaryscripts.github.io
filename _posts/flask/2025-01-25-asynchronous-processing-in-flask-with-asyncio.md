Flask, by default, is **synchronous**, meaning each request blocks execution until completion. This can be **inefficient** for applications handling **long-running or I/O-bound tasks** such as API calls, database queries, or file processing.

By integrating **AsyncIO**, we can achieve **non-blocking execution**, enhancing Flaskâ€™s responsiveness and scalability.

## Why Use AsyncIO in Flask?

### Traditional Flask Execution

- **Blocking:** Each request **waits** until completion before handling the next request.
- **Inefficient:** High-latency operations like **database queries** or **external API calls** slow down the application.

### Benefits of AsyncIO

- ðŸš€ **Concurrency**: Handles multiple I/O operations **simultaneously**.
- âš¡ **Faster response times**: Reduces request waiting time.
- ðŸ’¡ **Efficient resource utilization**: Prevents idle CPU time during I/O operations.

## Setting Up Async Flask

Flask 2.0+ supports **async functions** natively. However, Flaskâ€™s **WSGI-based** nature means that full async capabilities require an ASGI server like **Hypercorn** or **Uvicorn**.

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install flask asyncio hypercorn
```

## Writing an Async Flask Route

### Basic Async Route

```python
from flask import Flask
import asyncio

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/async")
async def async_route():
await asyncio.sleep(2)  # Simulating an async operation
return "Async Response"
```

### Running Flask with Hypercorn

Unlike Gunicorn, Hypercorn supports **async execution**. Start the server with:

```bash
hypercorn -b 0.0.0.0:8000 app:app
```

## Using AsyncIO for External API Calls

Instead of blocking calls with `requests`, use `httpx`:

```bash
pip install httpx
```

```python
import httpx

@app.route("/fetch-data")
async def fetch_data():
async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
response = await client.get("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1")
return response.json()
```

âœ… **Improves API response time**  
âœ… **Handles concurrent API requests efficiently**

## Async Database Queries with SQLAlchemy

Flask-SQLAlchemy is **blocking** by default. To enable async support, use `SQLAlchemy[asyncio]`:

```bash
pip install sqlalchemy[asyncio] psycopg[async]
```

### Define an Async Database Model

```python
from sqlalchemy.ext.asyncio import AsyncSession, create_async_engine
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker

DATABASE_URL = "postgresql+asyncpg://user:password@localhost/dbname"

engine = create_async_engine(DATABASE_URL, echo=True)
AsyncSessionLocal = sessionmaker(engine, class_=AsyncSession, expire_on_commit=False)
```

### Async Query Execution

```python
from models import User  # Assume User model is defined

async def get_user(user_id: int):
async with AsyncSessionLocal() as session:
result = await session.get(User, user_id)
return result
```

âœ… **Prevents Flask from blocking while querying the database**

## Running Background Tasks

For long-running tasks, Flask alone **is not ideal**. Instead, use **Celery** for true async background jobs.

### Install Celery

```bash
pip install celery
```

### Configure Celery

```python
from celery import Celery

celery = Celery(
"tasks",
broker="redis://localhost:6379/0",
backend="redis://localhost:6379/0"
)

@celery.task
def long_task():
import time
time.sleep(10)
return "Task Completed"
```

### Trigger the Background Task

```python
@app.route("/start-task")
def start_task():
task = long_task.delay()
return {"task_id": task.id}
```

âœ… **Prevents request blocking**  
âœ… **Handles long-running operations efficiently**

## Conclusion

Using **AsyncIO with Flask** significantly improves performance for I/O-heavy applications.

ðŸ”¹ **Use Hypercorn** for async support  
ðŸ”¹ **Optimize API calls with httpx**  
ðŸ”¹ **Run async database queries**  
ðŸ”¹ **Offload background tasks with Celery**

By implementing these techniques, your Flask application will be **faster, scalable, and more efficient** for high-performance web applications. ðŸš€
