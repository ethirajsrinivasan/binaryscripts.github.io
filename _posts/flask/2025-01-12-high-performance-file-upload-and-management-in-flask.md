Handling **large file uploads** efficiently in Flask can be challenging. Naive implementations can lead to **high memory consumption**, **slow performance**, and **server crashes**.

In this guide, we'll explore **high-performance techniques** for **file uploads, storage, and retrieval** in Flask, including:
- Streaming file uploads to avoid memory overload
- Asynchronous file handling for better scalability
- Chunked file uploads for large files
- Integrating with cloud storage solutions

By the end, you'll be able to **optimize file handling in Flask APIs** for speed and efficiency. ðŸš€

## Setting Up Flask for File Uploads

First, install Flask and required dependencies:

```sh
pip install flask werkzeug
```

Then, set up a basic Flask app:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from werkzeug.utils import secure_filename
import os

app = Flask(__name__)
UPLOAD_FOLDER = "uploads"
app.config["UPLOAD_FOLDER"] = UPLOAD_FOLDER

if not os.path.exists(UPLOAD_FOLDER):
os.makedirs(UPLOAD_FOLDER)
```

This initializes Flask and creates an **uploads directory** if it doesnâ€™t exist.

## Efficient File Upload Handling

### **1. Basic File Upload**

A simple file upload endpoint:

```python
@app.route('/upload', methods=['POST'])
def upload_file():
if "file" not in request.files:
return jsonify({"message": "No file uploaded"}), 400

    file = request.files["file"]
    if file.filename == "":
        return jsonify({"message": "No selected file"}), 400

    filename = secure_filename(file.filename)
    file.save(os.path.join(app.config["UPLOAD_FOLDER"], filename))
    return jsonify({"message": f"File {filename} uploaded successfully"}), 200
```

However, this method **loads the entire file into memory**, which is inefficient for large files.

### **2. Streaming File Uploads (Avoid Memory Overload)**

To prevent Flask from loading files into memory, **use file streaming**:

```python
@app.route('/stream-upload', methods=['POST'])
def stream_upload():
file = request.files.get("file")
if not file:
return jsonify({"message": "No file uploaded"}), 400

    filename = secure_filename(file.filename)
    file_path = os.path.join(app.config["UPLOAD_FOLDER"], filename)

    with open(file_path, "wb") as f:
        for chunk in file.stream:
            f.write(chunk)

    return jsonify({"message": f"File {filename} uploaded successfully"}), 200
```

This **writes the file in chunks**, preventing excessive memory usage.

### **3. Chunked File Upload (Handling Large Files)**

For **very large files**, chunked uploads split files into smaller parts:

**Client-Side Upload (Split File into Chunks)**  
```python
def split_file(file_path, chunk_size=5 * 1024 * 1024):  # 5MB per chunk
with open(file_path, "rb") as f:
chunk_number = 0
while chunk := f.read(chunk_size):
with open(f"{file_path}.part{chunk_number}", "wb") as chunk_file:
chunk_file.write(chunk)
chunk_number += 1
```

**Server-Side API to Accept Chunks**  
```python
@app.route('/chunk-upload', methods=['POST'])
def chunk_upload():
chunk = request.files.get("chunk")
chunk_index = request.form.get("index")
file_id = request.form.get("file_id")

    if not chunk or chunk_index is None or not file_id:
        return jsonify({"message": "Missing parameters"}), 400

    chunk_path = os.path.join(app.config["UPLOAD_FOLDER"], f"{file_id}.part{chunk_index}")
    chunk.save(chunk_path)

    return jsonify({"message": f"Chunk {chunk_index} received"}), 200
```

**Merging Chunks on the Server**  
```python
def merge_chunks(file_id, total_chunks):
file_path = os.path.join(app.config["UPLOAD_FOLDER"], file_id)
with open(file_path, "wb") as final_file:
for i in range(int(total_chunks)):
chunk_path = f"{file_path}.part{i}"
with open(chunk_path, "rb") as chunk_file:
final_file.write(chunk_file.read())
os.remove(chunk_path)
return file_path
```

This **reduces network failures** and allows resumable uploads.

## Asynchronous File Upload Processing

Uploading files in a **blocking request** can slow down Flask. Instead, **use Celery** for background file processing:

```sh
pip install celery redis
```

Configure Celery with Redis:

```python
from celery import Celery

def make_celery(app):
celery = Celery(
app.import_name,
backend="redis://localhost:6379/0",
broker="redis://localhost:6379/0",
)
celery.conf.update(app.config)
return celery

celery = make_celery(app)
```

Define an **asynchronous file processing task**:

```python
@celery.task
def process_uploaded_file(file_path):
# Simulate file processing
import time
time.sleep(5)
return f"Processed file {file_path}"
```

Trigger async processing after upload:

```python
@app.route('/async-upload', methods=['POST'])
def async_upload():
file = request.files.get("file")
if not file:
return jsonify({"message": "No file uploaded"}), 400

    filename = secure_filename(file.filename)
    file_path = os.path.join(app.config["UPLOAD_FOLDER"], filename)
    file.save(file_path)

    task = process_uploaded_file.delay(file_path)
    return jsonify({"message": f"File {filename} uploaded", "task_id": task.id}), 200
```

This **prevents API slowdowns** by delegating file processing to Celery.

## Integrating Cloud Storage (AWS S3)

For scalable file storage, integrate **AWS S3**:

```sh
pip install boto3
```

Configure AWS credentials:

```python
import boto3

s3 = boto3.client("s3", aws_access_key_id="YOUR_KEY", aws_secret_access_key="YOUR_SECRET")

@app.route('/upload-s3', methods=['POST'])
def upload_s3():
file = request.files.get("file")
if not file:
return jsonify({"message": "No file uploaded"}), 400

    filename = secure_filename(file.filename)
    s3.upload_fileobj(file, "your-bucket-name", filename)

    return jsonify({"message": f"File {filename} uploaded to S3"}), 200
```

This offloads **storage and retrieval** to the cloud.

## Conclusion

Optimizing file uploads in Flask involves:
- **Streaming uploads** to reduce memory usage
- **Chunked uploads** for handling large files
- **Asynchronous processing** to improve performance
- **Cloud storage integration** for scalability

With these techniques, your Flask app can **handle high-performance file uploads** efficiently! ðŸš€
