Security is a **critical** aspect of any web application. Flask provides several built-in security features, but implementing **custom middleware** can add additional layers of protection.

This guide will cover:

- What middleware is and how it works in Flask
- Implementing security-focused middleware
- Logging and monitoring requests
- Protecting against common threats

## Understanding Flask Middleware

Middleware in Flask allows you to **intercept** and **process** requests before they reach the view function or after the response is generated. This is useful for:

- **Authentication & Authorization**
- **Logging & Monitoring**
- **Request Validation**
- **Rate Limiting**

### Creating Custom Middleware in Flask

Flask does not have built-in middleware support like Django, but we can implement it using **before_request** and **after_request** hooks.

## Implementing Security Middleware

### 1. Logging Requests for Monitoring

Logging all incoming requests helps in detecting **suspicious activity**.

```python
from flask import Flask, request
import logging

app = Flask(__name__)
logging.basicConfig(filename="security.log", level=logging.INFO)

@app.before_request
def log_request():
logging.info(f"Request: {request.method} {request.path} from {request.remote_addr}")

@app.route("/")
def home():
return "Welcome to Secure Flask!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
app.run()
```

### 2. Implementing API Key Authentication

Restricting access to API endpoints using API keys adds an **authentication layer**.

```python
API_KEYS = {"secure-key-123"}  # Store securely

@app.before_request
def check_api_key():
api_key = request.headers.get("X-API-KEY")
if api_key not in API_KEYS:
return {"error": "Unauthorized"}, 403
```

### 3. Blocking Malicious User Agents

Prevent access from known malicious user agents.

```python
BLOCKED_AGENTS = ["BadBot", "ScraperBot"]

@app.before_request
def block_user_agents():
if request.user_agent.string in BLOCKED_AGENTS:
return {"error": "Forbidden"}, 403
```

### 4. Rate Limiting Requests

Prevent abuse by limiting request frequency.

```python
from flask_limiter import Limiter

limiter = Limiter(app, key_func=lambda: request.remote_addr)

@app.route("/secure-endpoint")
@limiter.limit("10 per minute")
def secure_data():
return {"message": "This is rate-limited"}
```

## Conclusion

Implementing custom Flask middleware improves **security** by logging requests, enforcing authentication, and preventing abuse. Combine middleware with **Flask extensions** like Flask-Limiter and Flask-Login for enhanced security.
