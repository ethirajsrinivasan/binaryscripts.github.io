**AWS Lambda** allows developers to run applications without managing servers, making it an excellent choice for **serverless Flask applications**. By integrating **AWS API Gateway**, we can deploy Flask-based APIs in a fully managed, scalable environment.

This guide covers:  
âœ… Setting up Flask for AWS Lambda  
âœ… Configuring API Gateway  
âœ… Deploying with **Zappa**  
âœ… Optimizing and troubleshooting

## Why Use AWS Lambda for Flask?

- **Scalability:** AWS handles automatic scaling
- **Cost-efficient:** Pay only for the execution time
- **Managed infrastructure:** No need to maintain servers
- **High availability:** Redundant and distributed

---

## Step 1: Setting Up Flask

First, install **Flask** and create a simple application.

```sh
pip install flask
```

### Creating a Flask App

```python
from flask import Flask, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def home():
return jsonify({"message": "Flask on AWS Lambda!"})

if __name__ == "__main__":
app.run(debug=True)
```

---

## Step 2: Installing Zappa for AWS Deployment

**Zappa** is a Python package that simplifies Flask deployment to AWS Lambda.

### Install Zappa

```sh
pip install zappa
```

### Initialize Zappa

Inside your project folder, run:

```sh
zappa init
```

This will prompt for:
- **S3 bucket** for Lambda packaging
- **AWS region** (choose the closest one)
- **Project name**

---

## Step 3: Deploying Flask on AWS Lambda

Once initialized, deploy the app using:

```sh
zappa deploy
```

After deployment, Zappa will return a **URL**, e.g.,:

```
https://abcd1234.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev
```

Your **Flask API** is now live on AWS Lambda! ðŸŽ‰

---

## Step 4: Configuring API Gateway

AWS API Gateway is used to route requests to the Lambda function.

### Updating API Gateway Settings

- Go to **AWS Console > API Gateway**
- Select the deployed API
- Under **CORS settings**, enable `OPTIONS` method
- Deploy API changes

---

## Step 5: Custom Domain & HTTPS

To use a custom domain:

```sh
zappa certify
```

This configures an **SSL certificate** for HTTPS.

---

## Step 6: Optimizing Performance

1. **Reduce Cold Start:** Use **provisioned concurrency**
2. **Optimize Response Time:** Enable API Gateway **caching**
3. **Reduce Deployment Size:** Use `requirements.txt`

---

## Step 7: Updating & Rolling Back

To update your function:

```sh
zappa update
```

To rollback to a previous version:

```sh
zappa rollback
```

---

## Conclusion

Deploying Flask on AWS Lambda with **Zappa** offers **scalability, cost savings, and serverless advantages**. With API Gateway integration, you can run **Flask APIs without managing servers**.
